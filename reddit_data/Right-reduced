Thats not new, freddiy gray was killed by black cops to (maybe one white guy was involved). Black cop, black kid, black police chief, black mayor, black president, black head of the DOJ and whats the problem? Racist white republican monsters.

Well said, OP.  I  too am tired of watching Trillions of our dollars go overseas to countries that we "support", it pissed me off even more that 2 weeks ago we sent a few hundred million to Mexico to build them a southern border wall....smh  Thank you for seeing past the main stream media that only calls us racist, we are not that. Grab a coat and let's MAGA!
That has definitely not been my experience

Did those people happen to commit suicide with five gunshot wounds to the head?
No its a full case, it will be tried, not thrown out.  I know Steve Kunzweiler, hes my wifes boss. Shelby will stand trial...it will be up to the jury after that.
Do not forget 100+ of Jim Crow under the Democrats..        The Blacks want reparations they need to take it right out of the Democrats Asses.

What did she do last night?
Yeah. It's a real tragedy because the old Daily Show crew would have been so goddamn amazing during this election. We need someone calling the media out on its bullshit, which is what they were so so good at. But now it's just BLM this and I'm from South Africa that and nonstop hahaha Drumpf is a basketball he's orange get it hahaha. I tried to be open minded about Trevor because Jon was relatively unknown when he took over too, but man, what a complete disappointment he's turned out to be. 
Lol, no. Not at all. People who are constantly talking about 'ending racism' while simultaneously judging other people on their skin color, and using that factor to silence them or invalidate an opinion or viewpoint... is COMMONPLACE these days. Hypocrisy at its finest. It's called Identity Politics. You can sub out 'racism' with 'sexism' and 'skin color' with 'gender identity' if you want. Same thing still applies. Still common place these days.

Is there nothing they won't blame white males for?

I was a teamster for over 35 years and we were always told to vote for the democrat, no matter who it was. We didn't fall for that shit. When Obama ran, we would ask each other if we were voting for Obama and the majority of us, blacks included, replied, "Fuck no, I'm not voting for him." Don't believe Teamsters and other union people are going to vote for Hillary Clinton. They may have union officials in their pocket, but they don't have union people.

I used to read this magazine in the '80s for men's fashion and decent articles.  *What a piece of crud now*. And go figure their articles (via their web site) are anti-Trump.   
Not if you're involved with the Clinton's.  Then all you have to do is tie words up in knots and ask what your definition of "is" is and then draw it out for a few years with your bluster and then say, "Hey!  Why are you bringing this up??  It's OLD!"  Unfortunately our country is so cucked that's literally been their only play for 20 years and it's worked beautifully and still works with half the shmucks in this country that need to get shlonged in November.    Stump Speech, Shlonged, Dicking Bimbos, Bigly.  Election years are the greatest for language.  Anyone remember how when Bush would say "nucular" instead of nuclear how it caught on and people pronounced it that way?  I see people saying Yuge and I don't even think they know they're saying it that way.  I can't wait till we're all waving our hands talking shit being honest with each other.  I honestly think it will be orders of magnitude better then PC pussy footing around every issue like we do now.

Female "circumcision" is worse than male. For starters, the female circumcision involves cutting off the clitoris and sometimes the labia of girls around puberty. This is highly painful, often not hygienic, and often lethal. If a girl lives, she doesn't have a clitoris, and most women need clitoral stimulation to orgasm (so she'll probably never orgasm). [[source]](http://www.onemedical.com/blog/live-well/female-orgasm/)  Not only that but the process of circumcising a female leaves hard scar tissue along the opening of the vagina, making sex even more painful. This is done to make the woman not want sex so she'll not enjoy it and sleep around.  Last time I checked, men could orgasm whether they were circumcised or not.
Why do they do this? 
Never heard a full-grown man ever use the phrase "THIS.  So much this."  First for everything, I suppose.  
Being a fat cuck is also the norm.

Which is why racial profiling is actually extremely effective.  In law enforcement, stopping civilians that "look" like criminals is surprisingly effective in catching illegal fire arms, drugs, etc. But then they stopped because it was 'racist' (despite being effective) and IIRC crime rates instantly went up after they stopped random checks.

&gt; you can see in the video from the helicopter that his car door was shut  The official story from the police is that he was reaching in through the window. Nobody ever said his door was open.  &gt; and there was blood on the window and door  Sure, that would always be the case.  &gt; meaning he didn't reach through the window (because it was closed)  That part remains to be proven. If the window is part-way down he can obviously reach into the car and still get blood on the door and the window.  It's also completely possible that his window was all the way up and from that angle (behind the vehicle) a panicky cop made a mistake while dealing with a crazy man high on PCP who wouldn't follow police commands. It could be that the first cop deployed the taser and she just spooked and fired her pistol like an idiot.  The likelihood that the cops told him to walk over to his car so they could get a good shot on him - one with a taser and the other with a handgun - and murder him in cold blood on camera? Pretty much nil. The BLM narrative is complete bunk.  Do the job of making a full finding of the facts before a court of law and act accordingly. Just have the riot gear handy when the verdict comes back, because it's going to get ugly.

Between the 1960's and the 1970's-ish (I'm not a history buff this is just some quick searching) the Republicans and Democrats we know to day were basically opposite. Then again I cant exactly say who were quote "democrats" and "republicans" when that vote was cast, so I could be wrong. But this post has gotten a lot of attention so I don't expect to get much attention anyway.

I believe it. Something that has really disturbed me is that there are riots in Charlotte and nothing in Tulsa.   It always seems like there are riots for the justified shootings. And no one does anything for the unjustified. Consider.   Mike Brown - riots  Tamir Rice 12 yr old killed - nothing  Freddie Gray - Riots  Eric Garner - some protests in NYC  Milwaukee guy - riots..   It's always the places and situations where the black guy killed deserved it that they riot. The times when a black guy gets killed, AND THE COP WAS ACTUALLY WRONG,  there's no riots, there's nothing.

Trump record: Not a Politician, extremely successful business man.  Hilary record: Lifelong politician, wasn't successful in anything.  Greatest achievement? Was able to stay married to Bill Clinton.
Am I reading this right?    &gt; The 24-year-old told The Daily Beast that he had used the pseudonym “NimbleRichMan” on Reddit with a password given him to by the organization’s founders.    So Nimble America is founded by OTHERS and they GAVE this account to Palmer. When did he take possession of it and was he even behind the keyboard when presenting Nimble America here?    EDit: So it looks like according to Daily Beast that, likely our FORMER mods, created Nimble America and attracted a billionaire money to it. Gave him a stupid named account that flaunts his money, rather than the ideas behind what makes these memes so persuasive.  They were courting money rather than pushing memes forward. I disagree with Daily Beats assessment that the memes were "white supremacist and anti-Semitic memes" it simply a statement that shows the Daily Beast's writers LACK OF UNDERSTANDING of 4chan/8chan subculture and what elements of it are here and what memes gain the most ground with Trump's core supporters here.

Trump is brilliant; he seeks to understand how things work because getting to the root of the matter is the only way to influence change.  He studies the nature of things so that he can manipulate the world around him, benevolently. When he finds himself out of his element, he surrounds himself with those that 'get it' based on his magnificent ability to judge the character of a person.  He recognizes the importance of ones value system.  I consider this entire election to be a clinic for me professionally.  I'm in awe.

Wow, really nice guys.  We definitely want more of them in our countries.
It really wouldn't though. He was assaulted, his family attacked. He was denigrated by the media, called a fascist, racist and nazi. He took over two decades of abuse....  Now he has been vindicated to a certain degree. His prophetic speeches have been especially potent around the globe.  But this isn't a feel good movie. He's still hated by the 48% of people in the UK that voted to remain. He still has to deal with imbeciles that call him every name under the sun (racist, prejudiced, hateful etc).  Farage is truly a great man, a patriot and probably the most influential politician in half a century in the UK. But his altruistic cause has brought a heavy personal cost.  I am glad he feels he can do what he wants now. He deserves it, and he deserves more time with his family. I cannot thank Farage enough for making the UK independent. And the history books will be in his favour. My biggest hope is that this movement spreads to the United States. We need to pull together again and remember who our friends are in this world.... Special Relationship 2.0+ - especially now we're away from the shackles of the EU and can work with our friends and commonwealth brothers around the world. Exciting times!

I agree that cooperation would be best for both states, but how would a friendly negotiation even begin? The reason I mentioned oil was because the US has essentially blocked Russia from obtaining oil and gas in areas of US interest (such as the Middle East). Further, NATO was created to halt the advance of communism (namely, from Russia) and is still being backed and enforced by the US. America seems to have put up a lot of barriers for Russia, which would be one of the first things Putin would likely want to negotiate.

Much of it is likely ignorance of how bad it is both quantitatively and qualitatively.   ***Most people are surprised that massive numbers of Muslim woman have never and can never have an orgasm.***  A good personal story about this was on NPR's This American Life. &gt; "We moved from the couch to the bed. I closed my eyes, counting to control my heartbeat and the nausea welling up inside me. Technically, we began having sex. Pain shot up my body. I could feel it in my teeth and in the muscles of my jaw. My insides felt like they were being sandpapered. The pain was everywhere. We didn't continue. My boyfriend kissed my forehead, reminded me he loved me, and left for the bathroom. I sat in the bed and cried." - http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/586/transcript   Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s book Infidel has good first person perspective on this. &gt; "What I never realized until reading her book is that for sex the man must tear through the scar tissue sealing the opening, and not only is this of course agony for the girl (it took her weeks to recover), it’s really hard work for him (often an extended process, even requiring a knife)." - https://rationaloptimist.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/ayaan-hirsi-ali-female-genital-mutilation-and-islam-warning-graphic-content/

I agree that circumcision of non-consenting children is unethical. I even made a comment criticising the fact that my younger brother was circumcised before I even met him, and in was outside the room when he was born. I see him and the bandage on his wiener, understand what has been done and almost immediately ask the doctor "why?".   What I mean to criticize even more is that this could just have easily been normalized for women in the United States.   It is frankly ridiculous to demonize this practice, the circumcision of non-consenting children, as if it is specific to any certain foreign culture.   Edits: words, grammar

Genital mutilation broadly refers to the permanent alteration of a person's genitals, in many, but not all cases, against their will or without their consent. For boys and men, this is most commonly known as circumcision or MGM (male genital mutilation). For girls and women, this is most commonly known as FGM (female genital mutilation). FGM involves a variety of practices. The least invasive are ritual drawings of blood or removal of the clitoral hood. The most invasive involve removal of the clitoris/labia and/or narrowing the vaginal opening with sutures.  In both cases, a person may have their genitals altered as a baby or later in life. In cases occurring later in life, some people volunteer for genital cutting for cultural reasons, such as a rite of passage. In many cases, those performing the genital cutting have also been cut and are performing the genital cutting on the same sex (ex. mohels on jewish boys, female village elders on girls).

Good God, that facebook page, this shit is fucking cancer.  "I get it, but I don't need a different/fancier word for rioting/looting to reshape it into something 'acceptable', cuz rioting/looting is a valid political act as is. 'Looting' seems to be the act/phrase that makes most people across the spectrum uncomfortable. It is a political act. If we think of capitalism as this power-an evil power that tells the poor &amp;marginalized they can't have, that they don't deserve, It is not hard to imagine the possible inherent political statement in the taking of materials/commodities that this power says is off limit to dispossessed people."

We must kill the demons we made. We have a national responsibility for this.  What does the current generation expect? Do they expect the developing nations to deal with the fallout from the decisions of our corrupt political/corporate hegemony? Do they think they can chase it away with accusations of racism and micro/macro aggression?  A war is required because not only are we responsible for standing up to the end of civilization as we know it and saying "No." we have a national onus to clean up the messes we allowed our politicians to make, and the righteous responsibility to make them all answer for it.  Make America Great Again isn't about just jobs and walls, its about this country leading the world...again, for real. And to lead the world, we must be willing to own our mistakes, fix them and truly defend freedom and human rights world wide....not just where the oil is or where the money is.  MAGA is about doing what is right, and unfortunately, thats going to require some hard fucking choices....I wish it could be done otherwise...but its what is needed.
Why is it wierd? Or did you actually buy their lies and believe feminists care about the well being of women?  Everything feminists stand for from destroying the family to patriarchy theory is horribly destructive and damaging to women.

The Germans were foederati who were invited to settle within the empire in return for military service. They were fleeing the Hunnic Confederation anyway and they had nowhere else to go. The problem, however was not the Germans, it was the cucking of the military and the lax standards of the late empire. The Roman Military didnt have any Romans in it.Once the Germans realized they made up the bulk of the military, they decided that instead of defending the empire for shitty pay and dirty looks from effeminate men in perfumed robes, they would do what they do best and just carve out independent kingdoms.

Cruz needs to do a few things. First off, being the Zodiac Killer cannot be easy. I understand psychopaths have the urge to kill, with psychological therapy and a good diet I'm sure we can purge his urge. Secondly, he needs to jump on the Trump Train. It was a great thing what Trump did the other day slamming Obama's plans to hand over our internet freedoms. That gave the two politicians some common ground to work with. They can work with each other. I feel that Cruz needs to disavow his relationship with Obama and Clinton. We've seen him kiss both their asses and he's given us a very Neo-Con vibe, like Paul Ryan.

Thanks!
&gt; mostly confused about __=s and the last for loop to print downward...  __ is a variable name.      __=s [_]   means the same as __ = string.uppercase[22]. Which is the same as __ = "W"  the + sign adds another character to the string  so +s[_/5] = +s[4] = +"E"  it just says __ = "WEWLAD" in a fancy manner   &gt; for _ in __:print _,  prints each character in the string __. It also adds a space before each character written unless it's the first character on a line. The comma at the end means it doesn't print a newline after each character.  &gt; print  prints a newline  &gt; for _ in __[1:]:print _  this is the same as the other for loop mostly. The [1:] makes it starts at the second character in __ (E). Since the print statement doesn't end with a comma it prints a newline after each character.  This is the same:      character=22          wewlad=s[character]+s[character/5]+s[character]+s[character/2]+s[character-character]+s[character/7]          for character in wewlad:print character,          print          for character in wewlad[1:]:print character

Good chance it was just a lot of SC criminals over on the second night using the riot as cover for theft. If this is the case, a disproportionate number of arrests would be from out of state. So 70% would not be representative of the rioters overall.  They may have been bus-ins, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was none.

This news is going to trigger so many libtard gaming people. I love it.
Most of the Bernie supporters I know are talking about not voting at all. They seem very disillusioned and even depressed. Glad to know some of them are getting angry instead. Anger moves energy. That's what we need. 
no, pretty sure all these articles are the false flag
I don't agree with that. There are still a lot of undecided people. Some are undecided on who to vote for, and some are undecided on whether to vote. Any new information against Clinton is good.
Hell yea we do. You drive down to little rock and get on the old train bridge converted walking bridge that crosses the Arkansas river by the Clinton Museum.   Get to the middle of the bridge and look down.   It's a joke. They actually disposed of the bodies around the maumelle part of the river.

Milo is obviously a narcissistic degenerate. 
I will say this for what seems like the hundredth time. It. Is. Irrelevant. Ending circumcision doesn't mean we stop giving a fuck about FGM. This isn't a zero sum game. Everyone can win. Nobody needs to be mutilated. You can be completely and totally against circumcision and be every bit as anti-FGM as anyone else. It's all terrible. It all needs to stop.  I would rather live in a world where we reject infant genital mutilation against everyone everywhere on principle. I don't want to live in a world where we make exceptions for genital mutilation against certain people i.e. boys.

I didn't believe it either until it was revealed that what people were spreading around as a Diazepam Pen (that her handler/Secret Service Guy was holding) for a seizure was in fact an L.E.D/Laser pointer.   It was originally said that this was for lighting a dimly lit backstage area in order to see clearly, but that doesn't make sense as it was an laser pointer and the light was focused on a single spot rather than spread out.  It makes sense that it was being used in order to prevent a freezing of gait episode that occurs with Parkinson's Sufferers.

Friday's a bad day to release anything. You'll notice anytime an administration wants to sweep a policy or event under the rug, they'll do it on a Friday.

Monday is a catch up day from the weekend. Tuesday gives a solid 4 days for the media to chew in shit...not that our media would actually report on anything negative about Hillary.

All my coworkers are vocal Trump supporters. I know I'm voting red. Never been asked for a poll and don't know anyone who has been asked for a poll so I'm really hoping we will flip Michigan. Lots of disenfranchised Bernie supporters (he had the shock primary result that went against polls here - Michigan polling is poor) and passionate Trump supporters here, but no real Hillary traction that I've seen.  The western suburbs of Detroit will be an anti-Hillary bastion and the rural areas will also most likely go Trump. The more liberal areas of Ann Arbor, Detroit, etc. will tend towards Hillary, but hopefully the democratic base is fractured enough. I believe!

Right, and a mail-in ballot can't get manipulated?  Or that a mail-in ballot can't have the votes recorded and linked to an individual?  There are so many things wrong with mail-in ballots that I can't even begin to describe the problems.  I get that in some rare circumstances where you need to vote absentee and the mail system is the only way your vote can even be recorded, but as a general election process I find it absurd.
Not any of those.

speaking of not trusting polls, there's a junk poll climbing /politics right now.  apparently SurveyMonkey polls by anti-Trump groups are news worthy now.     http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/297383-poll-nearly-half-of-voters-think-trump-will-detonate-a  &gt;Those are the findings of a new **poll conducted by SurveyMonkey** on behalf of the Lincoln Leadership Initiative, a new group helmed by prominent Republican **critics of Trump** who are advocating for the GOP to dump the nominee and return to its “foundational values.”  not only can they do whatever they want because it's an uncontrolled and not transparent internet poll prone to manipulation, but they're of course being manipulative with the questions and interpretation of answers too.    for instance, it's not "22% of people said yes" but "the average of responses given was 22%"   so even disregarding the fact that people trend away from the extremes when asked for a percentage between 1-100,  "supporters" trolling can answer 100% and offset 3 people saying 0%.

The 'ruling class' types push narrative thinking. This causes the little people to make facts fit the narrative (confirmation bias) rather than rejecting the narrative. Narratives are in themselves ok because they are theories that explain events. Likewise narratives must come after facts and not before. The whole Russian conspiracy is built on such wild narratives. There is already historical facts that lead me to reject the narrative. The neocon-neoliberals are on the wrong side of history.  I really don't know many Hillary supporters. And the ones I suspect of voting for Hillary, have nothing positive to say about Clinton. They don't know anything about her. But they repeat and believe idiotic claims like Trump isn't a good businessman or something like that. But when I meet them I always find something mental going on.... something has to explain the pure irrationality. It's really just establishment goons, mental-cases and people that haven't 'woke up' yet.

One thing I love about sports is that it transcends politics.   You could be the biggest liberal but if you went to the University of Florida, you and your mother had Tebow jersies.

The same can't be said about actors and most celebrities. Nowadays you're *lame* if you don't diss Trump.

Then again, I wonder how much turnout we're going to see in Detroit. The Democrats don't have a charismatic candidate like Obama. Unlike in 2008 and 2012, they aren't voting Democrat because they like the candidate. This means that they are necessarily going to be less fired up.  I think there's this assumption that strong Blue regions will come out like they did in 08 and 12, but I doubt it.
Here's the thing - you deserve it.  That's exactly what they anti-Trumpers think.   "I don't believe in violence against people exercising free speech except when....."

The biggest problem is that we were told our whole lives that having kids is very difficult and that we will regret it our whole lives, and if you have more than two kids you are looked at as a crazy person. Then the next thing you know is there are families coming to your country with 6 to 8 members, who don't represent nor respect your culture or your religion.   Almost everyone here has already realized we fucked up big time letting so many people in, but they won't tell because they would be very criticized and called Nazis.   This is literally a Muslim invation, and we know it. We are letting in the people who have been our enemies forever as if we MUST do it. This people wouldn't move a finger for us, they don't, and yet we have to give them all they want or they will cry like little babies to the government.

Well tbh this wasn't a bad video because the guy wasn't a total idiot drone, in the sense that "CUZ HE WACIST!!!!" without any evidence to support his argument (even though it was wrong).  Trump was never found to not be renting to blacks; the entire shit storm that occurred due to that was never at the fault of Trump directly. There is zero evidence to support the claim that there was any policy directive given by Trump to not rent to blacks. On top of that, the other issue people don't acknowledge is the fact that many of the people turned away were welfare recipients from an organization that supports housing poor black people. They try to support the claim with "well uhhh, we sent white and black people undercover!!" doesn't matter; there was never a direct order from Trump to refuse blacks.  &gt;insults women, very sexist  Yeah, one person, O'donnel, big deal, she lashed out at Trump and Trump hit back.

For comparison, here is a blip from the Kiplinger Tax Letter about Trumps (current, but ever updating) estate tax plan:   "He has called for taxing predeath appreciation in assets of large estates, subject to a 10mil-per-couple exemption. According to tax pros, he would do this by limiting the step-up basis for heirs who inherit capital assets from those estates."   Keep this in mind. Estate = person's shit after they die. A person's home and Xbox becomes converted into their "estate" when they are put in the coffin.    Also keep in mind, the Kiplinger blurb I put about Donald's plan is a revision from his previous stance: wanting to AX this tax entirely.   I'm only so versed in this area, and I'd love any further thoughts about this, but what it really seems at play is just Don trying to switch *when* the things that go into an estate get taxed. If, by his rules, he's able to tax the appreciation of your house and Xbox before you die, or shortly after you died but before the assets are part of an estate, then he *technically* is not taxing estate. He's taxing how much more expensive the things in the estates became before they were estates. My only dilemma is that nearly anything worth of value is going to get an appraisal if its going to be part of an estate. So, Donald will still tax estates (essentially) while saying he's going to end estate taxes and bash Hillary for even talking about them.   I hope I'm wrong, but it just seems two people throwing around different recipes for the same shit stew. At the end of the day, a 10-million exemption really means this applies to huge ass estates and not Old Joe inheriting his pops' house.
They're jelly
There we go with that word again. Bigotry.  Then you're gonna stay steadfast with your beliefs, and you're not going to explain the reasons that Trump will make this country more racist and full of this "bigotry." If you're not willing to argue your point, would you ever take the time to listen to someone elses?  If anyone's the bigot here, it's you.
more republican voting means trump is leading for now
AND IS OVERWEIGHT!  LMAO  That's funny they said Trump is overweight.  Let's put Hillary's numbers to the same test.  I want to hear that from the same source.  Unless they are sexist.  If they are, I need Hillary to disavow asap for any consideration.  ROFL
Trump mentioned farmers in the tweet so thats what I'm going by. No idea if they're exempt.
what if he lied? 
Good lord.

I don't normally wear my DJT regalia but rather I have a collection of anti-HRC T-shirts that I wear...Hillary for prison, Sabo's wicked witch monkeys, hillary killed my friends, etc... They seem to have more effect and drive an anti-HRC dialog which is often overheard by folks that I'm assuming are on the fence. That's my target...the undecided's.   Everytime I wear them I get compliments....even had an "I love your shirt" from a young black guy the other day. Her "career" needs to die the death of a 1000 cuts and then DJT delivers the head shot. BOOM!

Media sucks. They want the conflict so they attract more viewers.
I agree that San Jose was bad, but I was at the San Diego (Republican mayor) rally...what protests you saw on tv was not as "massive" as the MSM would have you believe.  The police chief announced there would be a zero tolerance policy for violent protests.  As soon as things started getting rowdy, the police stepped in and did their job.  In fact, Trump sent out a congratulatory tweet to the SDPD for a job well done.

No one dead, no one maimed, all but one kf the injured just scraped/bruised.  That has to be the worst terrorist I've ever seen.
Good. But what an unreliable lying sack of spuds.
So what, I should support the gov. pocketing income they've already taxed? Not to mention that the estate tax has been used by sharks to buy property and businesses cheap. 
We have the best demisexual bigender queens
Nearly every time the government attempts a forced solution, it creates the opposite effect. The more they try and tax, the more time people put toward trying to avoid the tax. The tax projections then fall short, so they call for more tax.

And to ensure your identity is stolen.  My wife (before we were married) got a letter from some dept saying her private info was stolen from gov servers a couple years ago. They signed her up for 2 years worth of identity theft *monitoring* and it does nothing if your info is actually used, only politely tells you youre being fucked. So now for the rest of our lives probably, we have to pay for a identity theft prevention/monitoring/remediation service like lifelock. I mean this from the bottom of my heart THANKS OBAMA.

HRC should be asked how much of her and Bill's money will be taxed at this rate when (if) they die.  I know the question won't be asked, and I know she wouldn't answer it regardless.  But the answer is zero.
Someone send [News Articles](http://www.newsweek.com/hillarys-shifting-stance-armenian-genocide-324799) to Kardashian on how Clinton refuses to call the Armenian Genocide a Genocide. 
i know right??  i keep wondering when San Francisco will wake up and figure out where their real interests lie.  its in the tipping point over 7% of the population when they will go from being your nice neighbor to being a group demanding Sharia Law in their neighborhoods and there can be no long term alliance between Gays and Muslims.
Bingo. This has zero impact on the super rich. The farmer or "new money" businesses are the ones that will get hit.

Even after being elevated, there is a mismatch in physical appearance which I think will favor Trump.  But I think the bigger problem for her is the increased risk of a fall or of distraction.

Nah, it's good timing all around. A good story to keep momentum going. Plus his convention shenanigans ended up actually consolidating people behind Trump. What he did was pissed off his own followers enough that they jumped ship. And the remaining never trumpers may agree with his never Hillary stance.
It just reminds of an episode of that 70s show.  Eric: "IT's a mystery! No one knows! Like why you hate Koreans!"  Red: "I know why I hate Koreans! They wouldn't stop shooting at me during the war!"

Better start staffing new mental wards now to be ready for the influx. 
I think Trump should run a serious TV ad that is just this song and shows scenes of the rust belt being revitalized with tons and tons and tons of modern factories (some automation but that's a force multiplier, factories will still need people to fix the machines!) and empty soup kitchens/welfare offices/ and job recruiters standing outside the gates of jails waiting to hire ex-cons as they are released from Hillary's prison camps.

Dumbest thing ever.  I give Trump 150% of my energy out of respect for my country. I jumped on board the train because I saw it was the only path to the change that is so desperately needed.  They should be truly afraid that this large group of highly enthusiastic supporters is here because we believe in our candidate and his plans for our country.  They should also be truly afraid that their only support is a few millionaires and a bunch of people paid to look like supporters.  Those two don't equal winning votes on the big day!

'Pede, Greetings, I remember being in your shoes not to long ago (not that long ok ;-) The reality, that you are already aware of this election, although you may not yet be able to vote, is remarkable.  Be proud that you are here, learning about the God Emperor and mindful of your future. I want you to know that when I go to the polls to vote, I will be voting not just for my kids, but also for you, and your friends.  Regardless of whether or not they support Trump. I've spent a great deal of time overseas, and I know how it can be in other countries.  We truly have the greatest country on earth.  But It is only the greatest country because we believe in a creed, a code, a document that lays out the rules of the road. If you don't believe in that document anymore, then the country collapses.   This is a fight for our very soul as a nation.  We must stand strong and work together, otherwise, we may as well kiss this all goodbye. Enjoy the rest of this election.  I know I wake up on pins and needles every day to see what's going to happen next! Be proud, Be strong, and Carry on young 'Pede!!!  MAAAGAAAAAA!!!!!

Yea, I absolutely think so. His [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yFhR1fKWG0) was probably the biggest troll I've ever seen. He somehow tricked the Ted organization into letting him speak and then got up there and just mocked them for 20 minutes straight. And the best part is, no one in the audience saw it coming. He was in a line up of serious speakers and presenting to a crowd of students looking to learn. It's literally one of the top five funniest videos I've ever seen.  So maybe he was telling the truth in that interview, but from what I've seen of him, I don't think he's ever spent a moment being serious.

The great reveal will be after the election. Just like how bengazi broke. If the thing is stolen, Soros riots. If its not, soros riots.  The first revolution was supported by a few and funded by fewer.  The 2nd revolution will be the same way.  Stand strong.  Cut the cable. Not having those shrill voices helps to reduce stress. 
They're also submitting questionable posts that could get us in trouble. Be on the lookout.

I hope Captain America isn't such a cuck. Please tell me he isn't a Hillary shill.

Of course!
Bonus point: his impeachment was for perjury and obstruction of justice.   Hillary has lied to the FBI - perjury   Hillary tried to have her emails destroyed and neglected to hand over all of her emails - obstruction of justice.   Case closed.

Cameraman suddenly cuts from front to side view. Why? You can see that ABC cut some footage right before the camera transition to side view. Hillary's head bobs up characteristically, and she loses control of her eyes. She answers, "oh, absolutely", before the reporter finishes asking the question, like she does at other points in the interview when she's losing it. Compare her head movements in the side view to the coffee shop seizure incident. Hillary's had another seizure, people!
FUCKING AWESOME! We need to all report in tomorrow!

The media only pretends to take him literally, and they are hoping their audience is dumb enough to buy the act. The flaw in their plan is that they think they are still relevant.

I still can't believe they gave Combetta access to all of Hillary's emails. How do we know for sure he doesn't have copies of those emails still...

They are unless they are liquidated for cash. Then it's capital gains. If it is a literal 'estate' you wish to inherit, don't sell it. If it is cash/monetary vehicles, it gets convoluted. Bank accounts: cash, ergo taxed. Unless the trust is joint and even then you have five years before it becomes subject to tax, and the executor of the trust has means to reduce the impact. As long as trusts don't show profits they aren't subject to tax, but expenses can offset that.
That is what I refer to when I say "reverse discrimination in admissions." The score they earn isn't changed, but what schools.will accept them with is a higher bar.

That's my understanding, also. I think it's probably the predominant Christian view on this dom, from what I've seen. The Westboro leaning types, if there are any, seem to keep their mouths shut.  Random fun fact: The koran never mentions Allah as a loving entity that loves its people.
Bauman, yep, that's the guy. I'd forgotten his name. I did a bunch of research on him when his name first popped up.   Good job with the map, I'll spend some time on this tomorrow and let you know what, if anything, I can add to your info.  Another guy who got offed, mysteriously, was Alex Okrent. He was in Chicago, working on the Obama campaign. He was gay, and rumors were that he'd witnessed some of obama's sketchy gay behavior while he was out there, and was going to make it public. I haven't mentioned it here, because our focus is getting Trump elected and investigating Clinton.  My point is, the Dems are dirty / evil, and it's easy to sign your own death warrant by working for them, being honest, and trying to expose what you've discovered.  Great work, centipede!! :-)

I do not agree with you  Milo was excellent at showing up the hypocrisy of the left and winning support of Gen X and Milennials who do not like old conservatives with their religious intolerance of gays  Milo was excellent at showing up the left had sold out every other minority in favour of intolerant fascism from Islamism  Milo went to ground zero of Orlando as a gay man to speak about the risk of importing large numbers of people from countries where killing gays is the law not the exception  Milo made it cool and rebellious to like Trump  Milo went toe to toe with the best of them  As far as I've read Milo did not shill. Milo was simply asked by 2 other moderators to go and verify some guy was who he said he was, which he did.  Milo was never an active Mod, he was brought in as a figurehead to unite the sub after the last civil war   I think it's false and faithless to dump Milo just because some idea was bad, didn't work out and he got caught up in it.

Obviously part of the Hillary team's attempt to "go after Trump supporters on the internet".  THIS is what they came up with.  This is their play to take credibility away from us.  They want to damage our legitimacy in the same manner that Corrupt The Record's failure damaged the legitimacy of anyone supporting a vote for Hillary in internet comments.  Don't fall for it.

Instead, he *forces it* to states, because he knows he can't negotiate or reach a deal without bending over.

It's not even that big of a secret. People just choose not to acknowledge it. The only people who give a fuck what he has to say are Democrats. The only reason he has a platform is because the Democrats have turned him into a weapon to trot out anytime a Democrat is in trouble. 
Huge dumps. 
Banking right, Donald tilted his head to see the flames and smoke trailing out from behind the Focke Wulf. "Another good rattle of the .50s oughta take her down **BIGLY**," he thought.   The vast American countryside looked skyward to see the coup de grace of yet another infamous pilot-tician. The markings gleamed off of Donald's polished fuselage, denoting so many other fallen foes. In stark contrast was Clinton's aircraft, black and charred from fire, its wings crooked, and desperately seeking evasive action.  Donald closed his maneuver and lined up for the final blow. Calmly resting his thumb on the trigger, he muttered:   "Hillary, you're fired."   ***BRATATATATATATATATATATATATATAT***

This is great, OP. Tha k you for supporting the Trump Campaign.   I've never seen anyone in Trump gear out in public despite living in a conservative, rural area, and I think I'd like to see more people standing up for their beliefs.    Trump will win this election in a landslide thanks to people who are not only vocal about it,  but also his silent majority.   Silly Clinton just keeps walking her rotten ass out the door with only physical support, but she knows damn well she has no chance in this election   Only people I see voting for Clinton are mostly just the uneducated and shills. I don't think she had any support.    Right now, not even the media can properly spin the narrative against Trump without making themselves look like fools. It's pathetic!   Getting on the Trump Train was very easy for me as a former Rand supporter. Not only did his endorsement help, but the media's unfair portrayal of him let me see how base the MSM and how I can no longer trust them. I saw for myself that most of it was slander against Trump.    This is going to be a historical election. Either were going to be living under an Orwellian dystopia or things are going to take a massive change for the better while the corruption that's been living under our noses gets shown for what it is.   For now, I'm just going to be enjoying the Trump Train. No brakes. Get me some keks from kuks  from our MSM and Democratic Party.   Oh, by the way, you've probably already noticed the pattern here in this comment. Sorry it's just tradition.

You know who else is actually really good at speaking, interrogation and holding people accountable without being a lawyer? Rand Paul he dgaf and will attack others for not doing what they should be. Trump was just so good at the debates that Rand didn't have a chance. But he is holding up the constitution of our country respectfully.

The problem is, people in the west are naive to the Muslim religion from the middle East. It's not the same thing as the muslim who has moderate beliefs that have lived in the west their whole life. We are talking about people who have 0 education and have only practiced the Quran under Sharia law their entire lives. They live a completely different way and have completely different views on life. Do you remember when the Europeans started taking over the west, and had literally nothing in common with cultural beliefs as the Indians? They ended up piliging Indian villages and spreading disease all over the place. This invasion of middle Eastern poor Muslim is close to the same thing. It's unfortunate that people of the west have such a poor naive irrational perspective about what Sharia Law and middle Eastern muslims actually believe and do. If they spent one day in Afghanistan or Pakistan, or Saudi Arabia, they would completely change their perspective on these cultures and the way they live. 
the CIA not being involved is gross negligence

I think you missed the point completely, but actually what you are saying isn't far from reality. Would you rather take advice about leading a country from a celebrity who doesn't even have to care about economics because everything is done for him by someone else, or from a guy with years of experience and knowledge?  Also, everyone has the right to tell you how to vote, but you don't have to listen to them. Unfortunately the mindset of many people is "well, I know him from television so he without a doubt thinks that way/is right/was not at all payed to say that."

Are you kidding me? David Duke is a Clinton plant? Why don't you people look into what he actually says. Trump has taught you not to trust the media, right? Then look into what Duke says himself. He's been fighting for Western civilization his whole life, and predicted things would be exactly as they are now decades ago. America is falling, and when the old guard falls, the new guard topples the statues of the old's. Look at what ISIS did. We can't let BLM illegally vandalize the Battle of New Orleans Andrew Jackson statue. Andrew Jackson was one of our greatest presents who fought the predator bankers and fought for us in the 1812 British invasion, and now his statue may be destroyed? His face removed from our currency? Duke is a hero standing up to these terrorists. Show some respect. #DukeForSenate

Actually, I think Democrats are kinda anxious to have Hillary and Still Dicking Bimbos Bill out of their way.   The Clintons have become too much baggage for the DNC even if they won the election. A Hillary tragedy while in office would cost them fucking decades before they recovered. They're quietly waiting for Hillary to lose, reinvent the party and move on. Many Democrats are extremely uncomfortable w/ the Clinton's history of shady dealings and ongoing investigations on several levels.
TYT hasn't been progressive for months now, ever since the primary ended.  Only Jordan Chariton and Jimmy Dore are left standing as actual progressives who refuse to vote for Clinton out of fear.
Actually Thomas Sowell pointed out that in Germany there is no racial correlation to IQ and there is also not a black subculture for black people in Germany so I would argue that stupidity is cultural and not genetic.

Mark Cuban is a dot-com bubble billionaire who has an ongoing conflict with Trump. He's taken (unsuccessful) swipes at Trump, and Trump has responded by pointing out Cuban's failed TV show (less than 1 season, The Benefactor) and by mocking Cuban's golf swing, among other things.  Basically, Trump is Lucy, Cuban is Charlie Brown, and the football is self-respect or success, depending on how you approach it.

Under the "Atoms for Peace" deal with Iran, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld gave Iran a nuclear reactor fueled with 95% enriched Uranium that was to 'breed' Plutonium. This reactor was in the hands if Iran and producing fissile fuel for thermonuclear weapons. They also gave Iran a deal for a fuel reprocessing plant to extract the Plutonium, and complete mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle.   Here is incontrovertible evidence of this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran  ---  Now, since it is a fact that Iran could have had a whole stockpile of nuclear warheads fifty mother-fucking years ago, but they traded that to Argentina for a low-enriched medical isotope reactor, **any ass-hat claiming Iran wants a 'bomb' should be written off as an idiot** with no knowledge of today's facts or history.   ---  Q: How many runways are in israel sutable to launch a jet bomber?  A: 13.  Q: How many missiles does Iran have that can hit runways in israel?  A: Ten Thousand or more.  Q: How capable would israel be in defending itself if all the runways in israel have bomb craters all over them?   A: israel would be completely helpless even to vintage cold-war-era aircraft and weapons  When Iran wants a Nuclear arsenal, it will pick it off the broken bones of a crushed israeli military. And that's only if Iran is nice and does not turn israel into a nuclear wasteland by bombing Dimona and the Nuke bomb storage bunkers inside israel. 
To be clear, if you take the Bible completely literally, you are commanded to love nonbelievers, offer its word to them so they can have the chance to choose to follow it or not.  The Quran commands you to dominate and slay the nonbelievers that don't convert.  Its a very clear difference.

Many people draw a distinction between the corruptible and corrupter. I do too.   If you are in a marketplace where people in power are willing to be bought, then it becomes impossible for regular people to not try to buy the politicians being bought without losing some competitive advantage (let's say, if your competitors buy them, rather than you).   For me, the problem is not the person doing the buying, the problem is the person who is willing to betray the trust of the people who put the individual in power for money.

Read up on interferon gamma - produced in the brain to both signal the immune system and slow the prefrontal cortex (like getting drunk) it makes you more sociable which leads to transmitting more disease and producing more interferon gamma.

I wasn't speaking specifically to a CZ for my budget (at least from what I've seen) the nicer ones are quite pricey. All guns have different tolerances and get dirty at different rates. You happen to own a very nice handgun that requires less. They do make some cheaper models, but with that price difference I would stick with the more expensive ones. $750+ difference must mean a lot in terms of quality. You are spot on with when and where, but after seeing some poorly maintained weapons and one explode in a friend's hands I just don't chance it anymore. From my experience the higher quality weapons usually don't require as much cleaning. My experience could differ quite a bit from yours.

One of the big "pro-life" things I keep hearing is that "Trump will throw women in prison for having an abortion".  This isn't true.  Trump was did an interview (which was edited to in the replays to smear him) where he was asked "Is abortion was made illegal, should a woman be punished for having an abortion?".  Trump paused thoughtfully and then said yes.  This is where liberals lose their minds and start foaming at the mouth, but if you stop and listen to the question it has nothing to do with abortion, much less if Trump himself wants to make abortion illegal and instead has everything to do with law and order.  Lets change the subject to keep simple minded people from being triggered by their own wild emotions.  "If X was made illegal, and a person did X should they be punished".  It was a loaded question. If he says yes "Trump is a crazy pro-life, woman hater!" if he says no "Trump flip flops on woman's rights and says he would let criminals break the law!".

The statistic is broken down into race and ethnicity with two of the categories being white and latino.  Hispanic would fall under latino.  But, hispanics are, in fact, majority white.

Liberals are insane so stay strong fellow centipede 
By having Hillary attack her visciously instead of Bill playing ball.
Loretta Lynch, James Comey (and his brother Peter Comey) all have ties to the Clintons.  Both should have recused themselves for the integrity of the process, but of course they did not, and the result is cleared.  Nepotism at its finest.  Google their names together and you'll find what you need.  Better yet, try Bing. You'll see what I mean.  Anyway, the best you can do is to get Hillary found guilty in form of public opinion.

&gt; beheaded for refusing to convert to Islam  According to the Quran's teaching, Muslims shouldn't accept conversions from someone who is an infidel their whole life and suddenly tries to "convert" at knifepoint.  Quran 4:18 - But **repentance is not [accepted] of those who [continue to] do evil deeds up until, when death comes to one of them**, he says, "Indeed, I have repented now," or of those who die while they are disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment.
Wish I could read it.
It's not surprising that there isn't anything at all about people around Hillary that doesn't look shady or suspicious.    
Maybe, Probably,  but if it seals the Election, the Supreme Court will be there for the Christians.  Maybe small price for the end game?
Correct. Doing so is a great way to become batshit insane.

Uhm, stop being so racist, would you? A few radicals don't define their whole movement, they just want to be treated equally by police.

If we don't shut the borders we'll inevitably be overrun.  Stop making the problem worse - we don't need 100K more jihadists from Syria next year, and that's what Hillary will give us, at a minimum.

In theory. And what I mean is these guns passed hands on the street with the intent to use for illegal means.  I think it's logical to oppose gun control but there are necessary precautions like background checks and mental health red flags to pay attention to. The founding fathers wrote 2A hoping people would have a constitutional education.  They didn't have the metal health and criminality problems at the scope we have them today.  That being said I subscribe to the notion that more legitimately armed people makes more a safer community.  It's tough to figure out. Barring citizens from guns doesn't stop the criminals, but letting the criminals walk around with guns doesn't wash either.   Simply put, it is illegal to use a gun for criminal activity and it is illegal for a felon to possess a gun. I'm fairly certain Wisconsin doesn't have any stricter standards than that.

It took two arms to strangle Detroit. The left was, well, the left (liberals gonna lib). The right's contribution was the corporate special interests that played part in crafting/exploiting NAFTA and securing their profits.     Thanks to pay to play and virtue signaling, the left seems to have taken control of a much larger share of the corporate greed as of late. Unlike Democrat's revisionist denial of their historic and ongoing racism, it is important for young conservatives to embrace and learn from the mistakes of letting corporations and evangelicals hijack their party. Trump will help see that through.

&gt; Asians tend to be conservative  I think this is a myth. This might apply to the older generation (perhaps immigrants) but the younger generation (Gen X and younger) was raised mostly in urban areas and were indoctrinated through liberal universities (high high attendance rate to universities), and now are at the age of buying homes and raising families only to teach their children liberal values. Asians tend to be good workers (engineers, doctors, etc, and little crime), which is good for society, but they also tend to not be good critical thinkers and so don't see the illogic of liberal principles. Also, they, including men, tend to be quite timid and won't question or go against what the other sheeple are doing. They are financially successful, and therefore comfortable, so they quite easily accept the status quo.

They are saying that this is in reference to the Packers - Seahawks playoff game in 2014-2015 season.  If memory serves me correct, Seattle won this game after some crazy onside kicks.  Therefore, he said he would vote for Hillary if Seattle won. Thus, he was going to vote for Hillary , and is a supporter of Hillary.
To be fair, there are many ways the little voting lever can be pulled: with an open mouth, either hand, or either foot. Hence, 5 votes.

This part of the official story is bugging me: &gt;security footage captured the suspect, at first entering the mall unarmed and later entering the Macy’s store with a weapon, and police will release additional images to the public. Police said they recovered a rifle at the scene but would not disclose additional details of the weapon.  So, where did he get the gun. If he didn't carry it into the mall with him, did he have it stashed somewhere? Just trying to figure out the logistics.

1. Data mining. None of the data you provide is secure/protected. Obama, for example, has made massive use of data mining, esp. for his 2012 election "win" ...one of the guys that masterminded the obama data mining campaign went on to co-found Vote.org, another online voter registration outfit. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/30/AR2007123002795.html  This is an old article (2002), but it explains the basics  [Data Mining of Voter Information](http://www.ombwatch.org/node/260)  tools being deployed during this campaign season that are opening up the voting process -- not to increase voter turnout, but to find out more information about voters. Internet marketers and candidates, through the use of data-mining tools, are combining individual voter records and personal commercial data to target candidates, issues, and products to specific segments of the population, potentially crossing the boundaries of individual privacy in the process. "Data mining" refers to any set of software tools or automated processes that can access data from one or more databases, and present them in a way that highlights previously unknown relationships and patterns. It is not, however, about simply presenting existing data in new forms.  2. Common sense, and support for Trump. Why support anything created by, backed by, used by, our opponents?

Because everyone isn't running around with semi auto rifles killing everyone as it is. The vast VAST majority of homocides are done with a handgun. What weapons don't you want civilians to have? Whens the last time you heard of a murder committed with a Barrett sniper rifle? Or a legal automatic weapon? You're looking at it backwards.  The 2nd amendment is in place for the people to OVERTHROW a government. The whole purpose is to be able to fight the military/state.   Crime and murder aren't done by guns, they're done by people, criminals. Instead of persecuting civilians, lock up the criminals and there's no one left to be shooting anyone. Law abidinig citizens dont go around attacking people with their "high powered" rifles.
I totally agree with most of you guys judging the BLM movement as a hate group. In Germany, where I'm from, these protesters could be arrested for the calls they make.   But it is almost as sad as the whole topic to see 90% of  comments being evenly indifferent and being the same hate speech stuff you try to call BLM out for.   I know there are many strong feelings for many Americans in this debate, but generalizing groups over individuals never is a good point to start from.

Assemble the centipedes! Show this poll no mercy!
I'm not too optimistic about black support or turnout for Trump though black turnout for Hillary is also doubtful.  Expecy him to get about 10% on election day, which is still pretty good.
RACISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
yes, you are right  they are particularly wily and they do lie  I'm not trying to say they don't they're the masters at it  look how they've infiltrated us. Just watch: the next battleground is "hate speech not free speech" as they try to censor the US and undermine the First Amendment  they've started on college campuses (muslim student organisations are Muslim Brotherhood and are very pro active)

Ask anyone here from PA, a lot of places that were formerly blue areas are voting red this year. Pennsylvania was one of the hardest hit states when industry jobs started moving elsewhere.  Then, the oil and gas boom happened. We started importing people instead of hemorrhaging them. The oilfields, and this is not an exaggeration, *saved my town*. Empty houses, abandoned lots, problems with drugs.... my little town was starting to just.... die. No jobs to be had. Now, we have businesses springing up, people moving in, house prices stabilizing, all because of the oil and gas opportunities here. Hillary wants to kill it. Fuck that.  Donald trump wants to double down on energy independence AND bring manufacturing jobs back to PA? A lot of people are excited about this. We used to supply half of the steel in the U.S. and I believe a third of the glass. If trump can bring these types of jobs back, combined with the jobs in coal, gas, and oil, i feel like Pennsylvania stands to gain the most from a trump victory. It's gonna be a god damn gold rush over here. If trump wins, I'd seriously start looking at PA as a new home, for those of you who have trouble finding work you can raise a family on.   I could raise a family of four on my salary alone (my wife still works, however), and my company can't find people fast enough. Our supervisor comes in to our daily safety meeting every other week it seems like to beg us to try to get our friends, family, anyone we know to apply, we get a referral bonus and they get a sign on bonus.  If hillary gets elected, this all goes away.... again.

The city itself would vote Democratic even if Jesus Christ was the republican nominee. Its just a matter of how well he does in the surrounding suburbs. I think Romney lost the suburbs by 500,000 votes in 2012. If he can cut that in half I think he wins the state.

Netherlands has already turned red with 919 votes 56% to Trump. but That is still the lowest percentage comparing to other Europe countries.
Maybe it has something to do with Jackson being removed from the $20 bill in favor of Harriet Tubman?!
The more Americans wake up to the 2-party establishment, the more likely it is for Trump to challenge in any state as an outsider. We're already looking at an expanded battleground map, and election analysts are clueless about whether states are deep or light blue and red.  Why this is important: any time a state flips from deep to light blue, and there are a lot, Clinton has to spend more money there and allocate more of her campaign and surrogates there. Any time her campaign is wrong and spends too little, the state has the potential to get out of control and turn into a battleground. At that point she can't just launch a couple ads and send her Veep. She has to spend a lot more money for the rest of the campaign and go there herself, which means she can't be somewhere else. The more this happens and the more unknown variables Trump injects into this race, the greater the chance that Clinton's campaign can't rely on their existing strategy and has to start thinking in terms of sacrificing one state for another.  Money, staff, volunteers, surrogates, the candidate... all are resources. Trump is basically running a guerilla campaign through nontraditional media and grass roots support, and Clinton's resources no matter how plentiful are being spread way too thin. Every dip in the polls for her or gain for Trump, no matter how small, is a victory for us because Clinton's resources just got spread that much thinner.

As much as I want to laugh, I actually feel sorry for these people. Media brainwashing can be a powerful thing and the psychological and physiological effects it can have are definitely real. Kind of reminds me of how many people actually commited suicide because of the 2012 thing which turned out to be nothing but a hoax..although some film maker hot rich because of it.  Do you think these poor people will commit suicide when Trump wins soon?

In Islam there is no separation between religion and state and all Muslims must jihad to institute sharia law and theocracy. The quran also advises taqiyya - lying to the infidel if it helps the cause of Islam.  I have every reason to assume a Muslim's policy is based on faith. You underestimate the amount of zeal required to be a muslim, it encompasses every part of their lives. What reason is there not to assume his policy is based on his faith?

Yeah well America really fucked up Iran with the Iranian revolution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) all for oil baby. Now it is sharia law [this is what is was like before](http://imgur.com/gallery/o8KTR). People always ask why they hate us, there are plenty of fucking reasons. I'm Australian I definitely hate terrorism, illegal immigration and extremist religions but when the US squarely  blames these countries for terrorism all I can think about is the fact that these people were fucking farmers before western countries started fucking with their shit.  People need to stop and ask questions and while out of the 2 candidates I am pro trump no matter who wins this election America loses, not because he is bad but because the country is so divided. It is at war with itself and abroad in places it can't afford. The thing is electing one person won't change a system built on buying policy, the senate is where the real power is and the fact that people can "buy" votes because senators can receive donations of unlimited size means that unless they really believe in the system, which is already broken, they will take the money and vote for others interests. A humorous part from a movie the dictator kinda sums that up (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUSiCEx3e-0). 
Thanks for the straw man.  The examples I set up only dealt with physical well-being rather than success in standing or wealth. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are guaranteed. Your pursuit is not impinged, but the success of it is.  This goes both ways. Claiming that not getting into your choice school or having a successful business impinges on your well-being? Forcing your competition out by way of law would impinge on their well-being.  Any public service that is supported and financed by the government is socialistic, period. It is the privatization of these public services without a public option that I disapprove of. Ever since I became politically active, the only thing coming out of the mouth from the right and Texas about these services is privatizing. This brings out a de facto monopoly where the services don't compete in certain areas because one already has the requisite infrastructure and the barrier to entry is too high to defend against investors. All the way back to Rome, history has examples of how this tends towards predatory actions against the people.  I want to be protected by enemies both foreign and *domestic*.

Yea it's a scary thing. Especially if you haven't travelled outside of the US, it's very hard to see through the illusion.
Medical and tech, yup. I don't work in that side of the industry, but I assume H1-B effects them as well. Not a single industry in western PA stands to gain more under the Clinton administration. 
I agree with your map, except that I think Trump is likelier to take NH than CO. If he actually takes that one district in ME, I don't see how he fails to take NH as well, thus giving the familiar 270-268 outcome and then we have to worry about Hillary trying for faithless electors. I very much hope I'm wrong and you're right.

Bold call centipede. If the running theory that the polls weren't accurate from the get go is true, it's definitely a call I can get behind. One thing these polls don't account for is turnout and I think turnout for Trump is going to be record breaking.

So our media informed us he was hispanic so that we won't know that he was muslim and will be more accepting of refugees that want to kill us?  Do I have it right?  
Like he said, he throws those things out there to pepper his trail with conspiracy theory noise to blend in to the rest of the clatter.
The only thing that is "incredible" is that there are actually some people who believe she IS honest.
I wouldnt be surprised if they have a ton of logic trees drawn out with every step + response by media planned out.
LEAVE THIS SKITTLE ALONE! 
I disagree - this shady back story which differs from the fake bullshittery they pedel only highlights the corrupt difference between what's presented and what's real 
If people didn't "get it" it's because they are not that bright...
I LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY AND WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS HISPANIC GANG ACTIVTY. We had a gang related shooting on the highway a couple summers ago. I'm not surprised he was Muslim, but honestly this was a fair assumption, not a conspiracy to throw hispanics under the bus. Thanks, now go be based.

I'm from Ohio but live in KY now. Everyone I know still from Ohio either doesn't care enough to vote or is voting Trump. Everyone hates Hillary, especially anyone old enough to remember all the factories leaving in the 90's.   So I think she is giving up, but I also think even if she tried people would tell her to go fuck herself.   Either way, Ohio is a big swing state, so get out and campaign, call family members, wear your stuff out, put up signs, phone bank, use social media anything!

Even when a muslim is about to kill a christian, they still don't say it even it saves their life.  Can't believe I've never seen this.  Although I wasn't looking.  Who didn't know this?

And he's supposed to be the debate moderator favorable to Trump? What a joke.
&gt;Then, in August 2014, Rahami’s dad told the authorities his son was a terrorist. Agents checked records and found nothing. When his father recanted, they say, they closed the book. Yet they never bothered to interview Ahmad Rahami himself.  Right there, that's the problem. If anyone here has ever dealt with people from the Middle East - this is utterly typical. You NEVER get the same story twice from them. They are almost all broken, and have hardly any grip on reality.  Interview him? What's the point..? If he makes admissions he'll just say he was 'angry' and try to sue for harassment.  You can't monitor an entire populace. They have to go BACK.
Can't stand seeing snapchat stories of ignorant privileged girls stealing trump signs because "they don't need them" or whatever dumb ass reason. I was message them saying that's theft and they are like who cares it's a trump sign! Like those people pay 25 dollars for them...

To most Muslims, its the latter. 
Pretty sure the Trojans worshiped the same gods as the Greeks. And if probably from the archeological records were an Indo-European speaking peoples.   The first REAL struggle between East vs West was the Greco-Persian wars. But that was less of what we consider the East today, but more of an authoritarian vs self-ruling conflict.

OK I see your point.
I can't argue that
Any question like that should be dismissed as not a debate question as it doesn't lead to any kind of discussion of policy between the two candidates. That's an interview or press conference question, not a debate question. A debate question should go like this: your opponent believes X, but you believe Y, explain why your policy is better.

She could not handle Birdie Sanders.  How on god's green earth did her handlers think she could deal with the flamethrower that is Trump.  I really wish Bernie could have been the guy because then we would have had a real debate of ideas and viewpoints.  That contest would have been healthy for our country.    But these men are cowards Donnie.  They are nihilists.  They don't believe in anything.  So Walter(Trump) is going to cruise to victory.

"You just lied on me"- It really says a great deal about a person when it's clear they don't understand the only language they speak. We have lowered the standard of the English language to include ebonics, and they have sunk further from being intelligible. At some point they will revert to gestures and grunting if we don't start holding them accountable. The reporter should have said "the video will show that I never got on top of you and lied down"

I really like Crowder. He'll give credit where it's due, admit if/when he's wrong, and he leaves his show open to anyone with differing opinions.    He said he'll openly debate anyone on the issues he takes a hard stance on ex wage gap, gun rights/control, and a bunch of stupid leftist bull shit that people come.up with

The propaganda is so strong here, it's not even funny anymore. Today, tax-funded media is holding a talk show with, amongst others, the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Schulz, a horrible man. He just said that he wished Sanders had won the nomination and would become president. Everyone on the show but one is Anti-Trump. The Pro-Trump is an American and they literally just asked him if he's retarded because he supports Trump.  I'm not backing down. Supporting the US was never easy here.

Any druggist would sell to her without batting an eye; he would assume she was on an errand for her parents." -- Harry Browne, Libertarian candidate for President in 1996 and 2000.   &gt; they haven't wanted military spending to be cut in a long time  Hahaha!  https://www.lp.org/lp-candidate-pledge-downsize-the-us-military  and they've had very similar planks in their platform each election, talking about all the money they'll save by closing bases in strategic locations and bringing the boys back home.

Any attack on Hillary is music to my ears, but Stein is full of crap here. The Russians are there by invitation of the Assad regime, whether you like him or not. That's why the Obama regime is sliding weapons in on the ground. The US hasn't engaged the Russians air to air, and When the US hit Syrian troops last week, the Russians launched protests, not missiles.    Shoot down of a Russian aircraft in contested airspace doesn't lead directly to MeRVs showering down on the US.  Stein would be MUCH more effective against Hillary by pointing out that the US's backdoor war on Assad is aiding ISIS.

Well, Franklin Pierce did basically start the Civil War and his presidency fractured The Union causing the Confederates states to succeed.   I'd say he was only slightly worse than Obama because of the whole "I literally fucked up so bad our entire nation is at risk of being no more."    Then there is also a few presidents before the 1929 crash that are comparable to Obama.   Long story short, Obama is quickly moving up on a list that we shouldn't be proud of.  Edit: thinking, while his presidency has not exactly been "great" or even "good" he still managed to break a race barrier that a lot of people never felt possible. So on that level, good. On the other level, look at the sky rocketing rates of gun violence of brother against brother. This is not cool. It's like this bitter cold irony. Something that can easily be fixed and maybe in 50 years we look back at his legacy differently but for right now, I give Obama a C- grade at the very best. If you're president, you better be getting B+ or have the expectation of being downgraded to another class. Sorry, he's an image of an idea. Not a man.

Thank you for your 'honest' opinion regarding my poor quality writing and titling style.  My question to you is, did you grasp the concepts I was trying to make understood in the main body of the submission? If you did grasp the concept, do you think it may have merit? If you grasped the concept, and think it may have merit, will you attempt to relate/transfer/tell others the concept?   Regardless of any 'IQ'  assertion, I propose that the concept I just enunciated in this post has NEVER been posted on the interwebs by any one else but me. That's right, of all 100 gazillion internet posts, this concept, spelled out in relatively few words, has NEVER been posted ANYWHERE on the interwebs.   If I tell you and someone else, and you and someone else tell two friends each the information I just posted, and so on and so on...  It would change the world, for the better.   Regardless of my otherwise poor qualities, at least I tried.   And, thanks for your time, consideration and comment. ♥

I have a feeling you may be right. I watched her horrendous DNC speech and hoped she'd choke, but she just screeched right on through.

He's getting people involved who have formerly given up.

YES... I though centrists and conservatives had not been exposed to the edgy important information I had.  And I thought they were stupid.  They like to say 'low information voters.  That means they think you're stupid.    I especially thought Southerners were extra stupid.. I would go around saying 'stupid' 'conservative' things in a Southern accent.  [cringe]  Now I see the South as having some problems maybe but generally having much  more *common sense* than us yankees.   And certainly better manners [although I never doubted that!]  I could elaborate on any of this but there's a basic idea.

So much this. There is precedence with the income tax. When the income tax was first passed the vast majority of Americans were excluded from paying it because the average income was well below the exemption ($ 750 avg income and the exemption was $3,000) and now just look at today.

Former burnout here almost maxed out on the donations to him during the primary.   The way I see it, with a non establishment Trump in the white house, we can shit all over the establishment DNC and GOP with one go. That's why it's so obvious the media wants to make sure Hillary is seen as a hero 24/7.  Even my mom who has been Democrat all her life said she is voting trump after I told her about all the bullshit lying and corruption the DNC pulled.   This is my Bernie or bust
Because they don't fear the right putting the screws to them and making them pay for the crime they've committed, even if it is this petty shit. Needs to change because mom and dad didn't teach them proper right from wrong.

Aww shucks, ok back to MAGA!
If shit gets real to the point of armed conflict, we will put up more of a fight than most probably think. Sweden has a very big hunting community and there are more legal arms around than most imagine. Sadly it is mostly rifles meanwhile the criminal immigrant gangs has ak-47s. But to finalize that anecdote, Sweden has the 9th most firearms per capita in the world. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country  And we too, hope that Trump will create a domino effect! That is a large reason why so many of us Europeans are as excited as if it was our own election. Many of us has lots of hope invested here.  We will fight! Same to you brother!

Generalizing and looking down on working class people? You're just like the imaginary Trump supporters you brought up, except real.
Classic liberal trying to label everyone. Maybe get used to the fact that Trump supporters don't discriminate based on skin color, like Hillary Clinton and the rest of the democrats do.  How much do you get paid to post this garbage?
Hillary supporters are walking around assuming any Trump supporter is a "racist" and should be ashamed. The [Hillary] supporters are completely ignorant. If you are wearing a MAGA hat for example, and walking down a street, you'd get a few dirty looks from Hillary supporters. Why is this? I believe most of the [Hillary] supporters are social justice warriors who have limited interactions with the real world.
I once confused him with Gary Johnson.
If Shillay wins there will never be a chance for another Sanders to ever have a chance to win again. Once they know they can commit voter fraud and still win they will never stop and the democrats will end democracy. I may not agree with Trumps policies but this election is a much larger vote then for the president, it's a vote to save our very democracy.

Hitlery could shot a black guy and express white power and somehow the media will make it about how Trump was racist and it was 80 degrees so Hillary got confused.   We're living in crazy world people. Trump or bust.

He did the right thing, and he paid for it with his life. He will be remembered. I will not forget his story. I will not forget Seth.  Democrat or not, he discovered the sickness in his Party, and meant to root it out. If we saw the same in our Party, I would hope we would do the same.  My wise Grandmother once said to me "Boy, always do the right thing, no matter what it costs you."  Based Seth Rich risked his life for his beliefs, and paid for his beliefs with his life.
There's a very real chance her campaign could be over tomorrow.
As funny as I find that, dredging it up now is absolutely no help at all fpr those of us who want to MAGA.  Shills may find it helpful, though... Interesting.  OUT.

Out of curiousity how far reaching is the jurisdiction of the estate tax? Do they have to die in the US or have most of their wealth in the US? If say a wealthy individual was going to kick it soon could they just move their wealth and themselves overseas and pass it down to their chosen benefactors there?

Welcome aboard the train with no brakes!  I was in the exact same position you were in. I strongly considered a protest vote, then came Donald J Trump's speech accepting the nomination. After that I disavowed and put on my coat. I'm damn proud to be part of this basket of deplorables, it's a fine basket.

Hmm, I'm not to informed about the brexit. But has the "aftermath" officially happened yet? I thought they had some time before they were forced to cut ties.  Or do you mean like how the public thought about the idea of brexit now that it has passed? If the former then I think more time might needed to see the what comes of it.
Yes. Live indicators of how you should be feeling towards a candidate.

They're morons. In a shop-talk type debate with my boss, he says,"All I know is if we get Trump **WE'RE GOING TO FUCKING WAARRR!**"  So I snapped and said, "With who, Ken? **FUCKING.. WITH WHOM?** THE SAME GUYS WE'RE ALREADY AT WAR WITH, AND HAVE BEEN FOR OVER A DECADE?! *If* **Hillary** *wins, we might go to war with* **RUSSIA**. How do you think that will work out? Russia has already ramped up their nuclear program, and made it no secret, that it's because they're afraid of a Clinton presidency. They're expected to have Nuclear first-strike capability by October, and we won't even be able to get our ICBMs into their airspace unless we basically shoot all of them at once."

Welcome, sir! You and I are similar - although I knew I would probably end up supporting Trump, since I was sure good and well Sanders wouldn't get the dem nom.   Trump and Sanders actually have more in common than many think.

Personally I can't wait until the media goes after her. They've mostly protected her so far, but pretty soon it's going to be more profitable for them to cover the biggest corruption scandal in American history (how could they *not*?).   As soon as there's blood in the water the sharks will feast. 
I hope he sticks to policy and maintains professional composure, and that Hillary continues to poke and prod and attack until it's glaringly obvious to everyone watching. After she shows herself as aggressive and irate, I'd love to see  him lead the discussion to foreign policy, her pay-to-play antics, and her anti-LGBT ties to Saudi Arabia.

Even if the stumping is overt, which it will be, we still need to jam on social media and stop CNN from spinning it. CNN's yoke on the public is still there, even if its loosened considerably this cycle.. They're going to have a highlight reel in the works the moment the debate starts cucksplaining how Hillary saved our dear republic.

Mind you these are the same people who think Justice Clarence Thomas is a sex offender.  Anyway, they treat it like it's no big deal and do some serious double think.  I even know one person who thought Andrew Brietbart, god rest his soul, was an asshole for "raking the muck" and "focusing on suck lewd things". When I heard that I wanted to punch them in the face. Brietbart had such an amazing impact on citizen journalism and likely affected the course of history in this country more than most us could ever hope to.

This is gonna be one of the biggest nights of the whole election. Lots of stuff riding on this. 
The trouble is that sometimes there are legitimate social justice problems and you don't really want to silence the people speaking up about it because the problem is they might be the ones who are being oppressed- you *need* people to speak up for the little guy.  The problem is when 16 year old Tumblrinas run with their free speech and apply it to total bullshit. Or when someone screws up, gets in trouble, then looks for someone to blame (like their skin color).

It's going to need to be a top priority, because after November 8th, the left is going to go psychotic.
I was reading up on the 969 movement in Myanmar (the Buddhist monks fighting the Rohingya Muslims) when Wikipedia suggested the BBS in the "See Also" section. I had no clue they had pushed Buddhists in Sri Lanka to the brink like this. Goes to show radical Islam can make even the most peaceful of people into extremists.
On the green screen theory I think it's basically "forced perspective" at work. The arena was misshaped - it was like a quadrant (baseball field sort of shape). So the supporters with phones in the air weren't facing the exact direction of the camera.  I agree it may have been an attempt by DNC to plant a conspiracy amongst us.  Can't wait for tonight's debate!  (I'm a Brit in the UK in a sea of Labour supporters and remain campaigners telling me Trump is evil. But I'm happily deplorable :) )

A very appropriate title. Here is a comment I just wrote about it on another thread:  He is pretending to be objective by talking about her scandals, but explaining away each by giving her every single possible benefit of the doubt. Brushing over the main issues and basically saying that she uses loopholes that are not technically illegal...While ignoring all the serious dishonesty and contradictions. Let's call these "ethical failings" if not crimes. He also trashes Trump every chance he gets and spends another 10 minutes or more going over his "scandals".  Conclusion: "It is dangerous the think that there are an equal number [of scandals] on both sides." LOL "and, you can be irritated by some of Hillary's, that is understandable, but you should then be fucking outraged by Trump."  He then goes on to ramble about "ethical failings" and how Trump as soooo many more than Clinton, forgetting he just explained that all her scandals were just ethical failings and nothing more.  This guys is a joke, I can't believe people listen to him and take him seriously.
Cheers. Will be at work so an online stream is my only hope. Don't think there's a single person in my office that thinks Trump is any better than scum, sadly.
These both look the same. Hill's is different.  This looks like a test run to make sure everything is working.   Not campaigns.

That is the thing. WHY would you be racist against blacks if it weren't more dangerous to approach them?  I don't want to be racist here. Because this IS not racist. If you are a black person you DO face the fact, that the police will be more alert around you. But that is not, because they hate black people. I think we mostly left THAT time behind us.  It's just when you approach a black male in a car that behaved strangely, you're more likely to get shot. And even if you're a black person and you are the nicest guy in the world, you sorta "pay" for that behavior.  This isn't right and we must look into why this is. But when a cop shoots a black person, that's not the "I-DON'T-LIKE-BLACKS"-Racism. That's "THAT-PERSON-COULD-SHOOT-ME"-Awareness.

&gt; Riots are rebellious, violent, last-resort acts to political or social wrongdoings.  I've heard that exact argument said in defense of BLM riots: the media keeps telling black people that everyone's out to get them, so when the media reports another black death, they think this is the only response they have for those wrongdoings.  But I think rioting is an idiotic response, no matter the situation.  Destroying your neighborhood, or anyone else's neighborhood for that matter, doesn't help your situation get better.  I can't think of a single hypothetical scenario made better by riots.  Protests sure, but not riots.

Play it cool at the debate tonight and the nail in the coffin just went 10 feet deeper.
I'm inclined to agree.  Just saying it would have been worse with 6 terms of one party.
From previous experience with cases like this (corruption, scandal and foul play) in the US politics, absolutely dick is going to happen and everyone walks free. I guarantee it. 
The MSM will do everything they can to decide for those people.      Watch any channel and you will see a panel lined up ready to give out their answer to who won. The token """unbiased""" panelists will say "Trump was strong, and stayed on message" but at the threat of death by the producers will declare that Hillary came out on top.       Bonus prediction: someone will call her the comeback kid.
If he holds Colorado, he wins anyway. 
If you're not in America, this won't show up as an option. So, that would make it a geotag, right?
So is the "custom" podium the smaller one for Hillary? So that she won't appear small? 
Lynch.. ha she is worthless
Doing it on the apple stuff would have triggered more liberals
Look at the faces that pompous, condescending, little twink in the split screen with her is making...It demonstrates the contempt him and his ilk have for most American citizens.
He's standing to her right at the larger podium.
GRAB A COAT TADPOLE
Yeah I see what you mean. It's definitely an issue. She's already talking about how she's going to try to bait him. As long as he can brush it off, and turn it around on her that would help.   I'm not as worried about that. What I'm worried about is if they bait him into saying something "racist" again. He's really gonna have to come in strong tonight. We will probably see a Trump different from the primary debates. 
I have been wondering why he surged during the DNC on that graph. Which part of it made that happen? Was it because people saw both sides and then the polls got more for him?
Nimble! 
Hillary does the bidding of her rich globalist donors like [George Soros](http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/george-soros-the-hillary-democrats-billionaire-puppetmaster/). If you're interested, here's a [high-res gif](https://i.sli.mg/O78z5a.gif).

Bill Maher is a rabid Hillary supporter but even he couldn't resist joking that they put her in her car "like a grandfather's clock."
Fuck all polls, vote Nov 8. 
We all know the polls are still cucked. Why isn't he 50 ahead?
The visit to mexico was only a week ago? My sense of time is warped by the internet...
That happens all the time. Doesn't fit the media/Soros narrative.
well enjoy it anyway fine centipede  spread the word to centipedes if you come across any aussie ones because nobody knows and there is no fb page or anything
He does have a nice watch though.
"Society's a weak excuse for a man" - Slick Rick.  That's the problem.  These punks aren't men, and they blame society.    Tracy Morgan said blacks lets their own people down when they came back from Vietnam.  Instead of taking the generation post-civil rights movement and progressing forward, they drank, did drugs, slept around, and this is where we are.  They put themselves in jail and had fatherless families.   It's two points: First about the affects of war. And second the acceptance of personal responsibility which SJW's and a small minority of the black population seem to avoid taking. They want to blame.   Hell, I could blame the molester that sent my life in a different direction, or I can push forward and do the best I can with the hand I was dealt.  
I wept.  10/10  Great read!
Wish we had this blasting at every commercial break.
I'm not 100% for Trump, but Clinton is human equal of a sloth - sure she's pleasant, but...

We'd need the entire audience to give up their seats to make sure there is enough room for all the bimbos Bill has dicked. 
she'll be hiring michael jackson's doctor to put her to sleep
Centipede from Florida, first time voting! I've been talking to other people about who they are voting for and most of the Hispanic people I talk to (we have many down here) are convinced Trump is going to deport them..... 
So anytime she opens her mouth? Got it!
Pittsburgh got wrecked harder than jose hernandezs boat did. 
These girls are a couple of savages. And by girls I don't mean the wicked witch of the west in the middle.
Wait, the what now?
Colorado, and the nation, are on the cusp of being uncucked!  MAGA, folks.
K. Keep me posted. 
What's she like as a neighbor?  Lots of block parties, always a bundle of joy to be around?
There's no doubt Trump is the only viable candidate for America. But we've seen how deep the corruption goes. Never underestimate the power of sneaky corrupt snakes like Clinton. We need to be alert and look for every possible trick they will use to get her elected. Even if he crush her tonight we need to be vigilant and alert.

It's the type of speak the Euros have been going through for decades. The left loves making the right into literally hitler any chance they get. Hitler was fascist, by today standards Churchill would be a nationalist.
Fucking cisgender straight green male! #GreenLivesMatter
This. They're allowing Trump to take a small lead on the eve of the debate in order to manufacture a huge rebound for Hillary tomorrow and make it seem like she crushed him. They did the same thing during the DNC. This is intended as their killshot. Don't get complacent now and don't get discouraged when Hillary rebounds - it's all lies
[deleted]
This is brand new, updated 45 min ago or so by Nate Plastic.  I suppose that there are so many states where Trump is @ 40% or higher to win (like 5), that there is an extremely high chance would win at least 2 of those 5 states (Colorado and NH for example), thus putting him in the lead.
Fuck this cunt and his horseshit.  We are winning and we are going to blow this fucking hag out of the water and we're done with that?  Step two:  we destroy the liberal media and fuck them into the ground while the hag goes to trial for her crimes along with ALL those who are complicit.    Electing Trump is only the beginning.  This is a revolution and a war and we will fuck our enemies into the dirt without mercy.
That's ok,  let them think they're winning. I like being the under dog

They know it better than anyone- we **need** the wall!
I love Copenhagen and the Danish language, it's great. But a high degree of government control, and high taxes, will eventually degrade the culture, even though it's happening a little slower or later in Denmark than in Sweden. High taxes remove much of the incentive to be a productive and friendly participant of society and inevitably pushes the culture further down the decline.  But I'm interviewing for a company with Norwegian connections, so we'll see. Maybe a high wage here can be invested wisely abroad so we can retire early. I have some potential investments in mind.
I no longer believe /r/politics is shilling for any particular candidate. I think it is a front for an international [salt mining consortium](https://i.sli.mg/0wVC9U.jpg).

Asking Holt to fact-check Trump under the assumption that Trump lies is like asking the moderator of the GOP debates to question Trump about his weight while he stands next to Chris Christie.  
my thoughts exactly 
Huma with a hidden ear piece ?

That was so cool. Brobot took one for the team
"As a white male, let me make these condescending faces because you're wrong about your feelings."
This changed back to 51% to 48% in favor of Hillary.    The backlash he must have received was probably pretty glorious.   * gotcha.  Gotta hit that drop down.  
ex-Emps are the worst, we must kill them all
We have the best black female white males, don't we folks?
&gt; nothing he said was actually racist  Making an assumption that someone might hurt you because of their skin color sounds pretty racist to me. Regardless, it is worth pointing out because you know the shitstorm that would ensue if Trump said anything like this.

FWIW, I heard pretty much all of the pre-spun media reporting that Arcan Cetin couldn't have voted for Hillary Clinton because he was not a US citizen.  He was most definitely a US citizen.    He arrived in the US as a child.  He is 20 years old now.  It appears from his dad's FacePlace account that he married his mom and brought them over.  The time line is not definite, but it appears this happened likely when Arcan was around 10-12 years old.  Next we look at the Child Citizenship Act of 2001.  It says that at the moment that Arcan arrived in the US and took up residence with his US citizen dad, Arcan then AUTOMATICALLY became a US citizen.  https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/ChildCitizenshipAct_120100.pdf  Suck it Hillaroids!

if it legal immigrant community then that's great
RemindMe! in 1 hour about how many bots can we trip? Buy Pepe, Build the Wall, 10 feet higher, get on the Trump Train, Lock her up, get this man a coat, vote, election.
For the most part the Republicans have been upfront, but not with illegal immigration. Trump is the first to actually take a stand and recognize that its not good for anyone. 
Absolutly disgusting.  Nate should be in fucking prison for spreading anti american propaganda.
Ya know, I've asked everyone in my circle if who they are voting for, and none of them have said Hillary. It's either Trump or they hate both. Sadly, the reasoning for hating trump is a BINGO format made by CNN. I eventually get through their list and get them to admit Trump isn't that bad, but the negatives the media has given leaves them still hesitant.   On topic though, Florida is going Red. Red. Red.
I met a cuck voting for shillary, and I asked him why, and he told me the site 538 said so. cucks btfo! This is MAGA country!

how dare u assume my pronouns
The balls on some people to sit in their middle-class neighborhoods thousands of miles from the border and condemn the right for wanting strict immigration, while damn near every person or agency that **actually deals with immigrants** is practically begging for Trump to build the wall and lock down the borders. I bet if Hillary offered to resettle Mexican border jumpers or Muslim refugees directly to Suburbia, USA, people would have a change of heart.    
Mine is, but /politics's isn't. The saltiness over trump bearing her in Colorado and about to do the same in Pennsylvania have surfaced. So much resignation from the Clinton camp. We have already won, we just need to show up and vote.

I think I remember Alex saying there are going to be two streams. One that's a live, uninterrupted feed directly from the debate and one that has Alex et al doing commentary during breaks/Hillary coughing fits.  It's the first time InfoWars fully licenced out a direct feed - meaning they don't have to do commentary to bypass licensing laws.
Seriously. White lives matter folks! We built this country and by God's grace we'll take it back this November.  Edit: keep down voting me you SJW cucks. You can't handle the fact that the us was built by white sweat and blood.

Indeed. Just because they didn't go to the DMV and sign the papers doesn't mean they arnt directly responsible for the situation via their foreign policy. Bush certainly helped set the stage though.
 /r/hittablefaces. :)  /r/punchablefaces has been taken over by SRS. 
Thats what they did here with the last time we had to vote for something. There was a push to make people not vote at all, so the vote would swing their way. When it didnt (just like Brexit) they were all crying about voting in general.   Like what the fuck, you say you are pro democracy yet you use a tactic to make people not vote at all, so that the votes swings your way.... They dont care about democracy if the outcome will not be the outcome they had in thought...
The only way Nate is getting any shred of credibility back is if he calls out the landslide before anyone else.  He doesn't have the balls though.
"I think he is Hindu as well"? Some of these commenters on twitter don't understand how this works.   Also, source?
And who'd argue that he died to due complications from chronic venereal diseases? After all he is still dicking bimbos.

There's been at least 5 new ones created today since the new poll information came out.  Tendies are hitting the floor all over political subs
That anchor was holding back from screaming but trump hates terrorists and all terrorists are Muslim shitlord reeeeeeee!
&gt; It's bad enough they already call Hillary's daughter "Chelsea Clinton" without any proof...  ...that she's Bill's daughter too.
Should've had someone hold the hat to make it look like Washington was wearing it.
Better to be a "racist" than to be beheaded. 
Tonight's debate is broken into three 15min sections: National Security, The Economy, and The Direction of the Country.   I don't doubt she'll try to throw this at him, but she won't be able to give it very much time. If she says "tax returns" he can say "Goldman Sachs Transcripts".   I love Trump but there's a reason he hasn't released the tax returns. My theory is they'll find out he has donated more to Clintons than any other political family. Trump has never been shy about telling people he has donated to candidates from all parties, but her being a New York senator and resident and he being an early critic of Obama, he likely donated quite a bit to her, especially in 2008.

not sure this is an exact quote, bu kac was working for the other side during the primary and there is a video of her shitting on trump a few times.
Who **is** he actually inviting? I haven't heard a thing on it.
No they won't, that's just ridiculous. They will stone you to death.   
Really clever line of persuasion from Adams, knowing that alcoholism isn't something Dems can use to attack Trump.  
These guys are the ones who actually deal with illegal aliens. They know the heinous acts cartel members and criminals done and deal with it on a daily basis. If this is any sign, especially to the independents who find this issue important, it shows that Trump has a plan that is satisfactory with those who have to deal with it.
Being a college student in PA (who has never voted but is registered) I can say that this does not surprise me at all and expect Trump to win PA. Most of my fellow student Trump supporters are registered voters and are extremely excited to vote. Whereas the Hillary supporters (wherever they may be because you cant find many) are hardly registered and not enthusiastic. New voters will win PA for Trump mark my words.
They need to take her coat and suicide it.

Aside from the sad loss of life, think about how much useful and vital information he could have shared with our intelligence officials that they now don't have. 
I'm for both as I believe in heaven and hell. I believe that it our duty on this side of eternity to protect those who need protecting by any means necessary and letting God have the last word with the people who do this sort of thing.   The hell that awaits people who don't disavow this sort of behavior is far worse than anything we could ever do to them, however these children deserve and require our help to protect them. 
Yes!  My home state. Love seeing that on reddit

Nah dude. We formed that state for them. If there's one place on earth that's not physically connected to our borders that deserves our continued presence and assistance it's Israel. 
Thanks!! 
DEFINITELY NOT PBS. I remember watching them during the convention, and their bias was obvious. The casters always had this disgusted look on their face and they repeatedly cut to nevertrumpers during key speeches.
A combo that kek himself would approve of.
I heard of a guy named Anthony who would make a good co-host for a radio showgram.
Rage inducing. Every Marine has their creed thrown in their face with that picture.
I love how people make Rosie the victim in all of this when she was 100% the aggressor. She attacked both Trump and the young woman he was trying to help. The public wanted that poor girl destroyed for her mistake, and Trump said "nah".   Rosie is a despicable woman, and a fake ass bitch. Even her own daughter hates her.

Haha. Never mentions how he returned to Iran in 2010 and was a free man until Hillary's emails came out leading to his execution in Aug, 2016. If Iran wanted to execute him regardless, they wouldn't have waited 6 years. 
A shit on stage is the only way she can upstage herself dying on 9/11
I doubt that wiki leaks will drop just before the debate, it wouldn't be brought up during the debate most likely. Donald Trump likely has no idea what's in the leak and it normally takes hours to days to sort through the information, and remember it's very likely that the only candidate that knows what's in the leaks is Hillary! So she may have already prepared for this bombshell with retorts and deflections.
It looks like a DOOM enemy after you've killed it.

Lmao true dat 
Deporting us is illegal. You know what isn't? Moving yourselves on over to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Head on over to those heavily Muslim countries, if you want to make that claim proven. Live among those people, don't change your lifestyles for protection. Test your claim. See how tolerant they are of feminists and men who take a submissive role to women.
What if you told that "42" year old that it's not that 50% of the US is racist, etc. But 50% of the US is fed up with people's like her. And I'm saying her because a woman or a beta nu-male wrote this. 
While it's true that more states are red by far, the issue is the amount of electoral votes each state holds. That's why certain states like Florida are more important than say, Rhode Island.
These are refunds, not contributions (specifically the Bernie line items). That might explain why he got refunds though.

&gt; This is, however, completely against the directives of Barack Obama who is vehemently opposed to any notion that Islamic teachings command terrorism.   Cares more about his own religion than the American Citizens. He shouldn't be leading this nation with that attitude. And by extension Hillary. Though her motives for promoting Islam is probably Money based via her Saudi Donors. 
Honestly they're not very bright but sure seem to think they are!

You were close, his ex-wife said in an interview that it was actually 9 INCHES LONG. Trump's a pure alpha male.
In Soviet Russia, Parkinson bug beat you.
Although I am atheist myself, I do not find it offensive if people mention God or prayer or whatever, even in a political setting.  (Our pledge of Allegiance has "Under God", but it doesn't bother me)  You need to understand that it's one thing to mention these things, and it's quite another for their religion to shape policy.  If someone says "Bless you" to me when I sneeze, I don't snap back at them "I'm atheist!".  That's just rude.  They were only being polite.  Likewise, in a situation like in this thread, where people are asking for prayer for this poor girl and others like her, it's bad form to attack those who legitimately care about the girl because they are putting their beliefs in the discussion.  It's not important.  Now, if they specifically said, "The only thing we can do is pray, and nothing else can be done, just put our faith in God", well, then you might have grounds to call them out on that and say, "Wait a second, no.  We can actually do more to help"  I hope I cleared things up a bit.  tl;dr:  You can be an Athiest, but don't be a dick.

No such thing as FYROM. By that logic, Greece should be the Former Ottoman Conquest of Greece. Quit sucking the EU teet and worry about your own four walls and the horrible state your society is in before you look over the fence and complain about a name. It's quite Islamist to try to force other societies to use "safe names" and "approved language".

CSpan or Fox. Don't give CNN any clicks.
I took a mental note of all the people on cuckbook who said "donald trump won't be president, lol" on my friends list. I'm from CA, so you can picture the cuckyness.   I been rooting for Donald since August..of last year.   When he wins in November, I will go back to all these cuckbook posts/comments/status's and merely click "Like"   They'll get a 1 year reminder "zinrokh has liked your comment."   No words. No comments. No debate. Just a simple like.   It's going to be biblical. 
wrong, only laser printers have this. It's called printer steganography, and will usually yield nothing other than the type of printer. not who purchased it, lol
That's because we have the best people.
Did you get this from Can't Stump the Trump?
"Your opinion is wrong and my opinion is right" we can't be friends dude. Liberal logic.

You don't know what you are talking about.   1. Many university courses are taught by graduate students / postdocs (universities want to cut cost). For many disciplines, the majority of graduate students / postdocs are from foreign countries.   2. When universities hire academic staffs, they look at research funding and publications. They don't care about English (especially English accent). Many brilliant researchers, who are leaders in their fields, speak with very strong accent.    3. At least for science and engineering (except maybe mathematics), getting an academic job is a lot more difficult than getting an industry job. In my field, an academic opening in a shit town attracts 400 applications, and everyone of them at least has a PhD (and I would say for most of them, if they ever want to go to industry, there'd have plenty of offers to choose from).

There should be, and the live feed, I posted a link for it on YouTube, apparently isn't up yet. I don't know what's going on with that, but I'm pretty sure it was originally posted by the account Trump used for his AMA. 
The real debate: does trump go on the left of Washington or the right of Lincoln?
lol now it's 14 millions
Oh good, she's getting loud.
Watching on CBS. When on split screen Hillary's screen is magnafied to make her look bigger than Trump. The lettering behind them is not the same size. Subtle.

I'm all for trump but yes, during her 2 min she should be allowed to talk. After the 2 min he should destroy her every chance. He's getting worked up and that's understandable for a man who loves his country. But, the rules are no talking during her 2 min, she's letting him.

literally as I typed that.
It's so ridiculous, she looks down and reads the answers.

Bababooey

Fuck you Lester.
Here just got baited. 
The problem about him saying this is that this will now be used against him. It was obviously a bad joke (and he was probably absent minded), but unfortunately there are easily triggered people will take it as an insult for some stupid reason and the media will feed on them. Just wait.
i'M SO FUCKING TRIGGERED

Her smile is so off putting. Her gums look infected. Also, Lester Holt is a lying cuck.
I agree. I still believe in him, but he's going into rant-mode. She'll play off it. It's not going well for him. Temperament is making it ironic.
Yeah he just comes off like a regular guy, she seems utterly fake and politiking her ass off
leave.

She won't stop lying. 
Hillary is a total warhawk. Don't let her get away with this Don. 
Ah, they said the same thing about Reagan...he's a cowboy, blah blah blah, can't be trusted with nukes. He pummeled the USSR and never had to use a nuke.

For her to have her hand facing the camera ("on top"), her thumb would have to be down, her pinkie upward, and her arm twisted into a really weird position.  They're standing in front of their respective podiums. Had the podiums' position been reversed, her hand would have been the one "on top".  BTW, the word is "dominant".  Nitpicking I know but using "dominate" as an adjective is like nails on a blackboard to me.
He's went toe to toe with her, a seasoned politician, he's went above and beyond my expectations.

What a fucking pointless final question.
I was happy with the first 30 minutes. You could see Trump settle down and get a little more comfortable. Then Lester asked the birther question with TWO follow ups and Trump lost his momentum. Hillary took it from there.   Damn. Why didn't he hit her with the home brew bathroom server when they were on Cybersecurity?   I think Trump lost, guys. 
Quote of the night, right there.
fuck you shitlord this is racist.
Hillary's just jealous she can't be a beauty queen. All she can do is pretend with Huma.
He didn't do it false alarm.  I was so fucking expecting DICKING BIMBOS.
A lot of people in the audience clapping for Trump are going to suicide themselves three times in the back of the head with a bag over their head tonight.
Hillary don't choke when you wrap yourself in that USA flag.
#Make America Great Again
She looks really high.
Was there even a single policy question tonight?
Trump could have done better. He hurt himself I believe
[removed]
He's being political. It's not giving the media too much to nit pick
This was a very disappointing debate. Hopefully the next one will be better...
Right on.
Trump
Great job under tough circumstances....got a lot of crap out of the way for the next two debates and still has plenty of meat to go after her
42k NOW
Lester the molester hurled tough questions at Trump and easy ones at Crooked. He wasted too much time on the Iraq War and he squandered his chance to counter attack about her vote for the war. 
Quiet
Look, he probably underprepared and stumbled. Lets not be cucks and deny reality. He could have done better, but this won't cost us an election.
I respect all yall's opinions. Can anyone hook me up with some sources to help me understand the facts that's were discussed. Much appreciation guys
[deleted]
Here's my question.  She says Trump wants to pass a tax cut so he doesn't have to pay any taxes.  Then she says he won't release his taxes because he pays such a low rate. Also, the two tax returns he had to release when building a casino showed he paid nearly no taxes.  Sounds like the tax code works for him, why does he need to change it?
SEND IN THE DROPBEARS.
Breitbart Poll has trump up 80% to 19% Hillary  http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/poll-won-first-presidential-debate/
/r/politics had 4 separate threads for the debate.
so they put the 18min mark just to say something good about clinton?  biased af  Also Trump roasted her with she has been preparing 30 years. And telling how a mess she has been as a politician.
Trump did not attack as much as I expected. He was very aggressive though.
First debate jitters out of the way. I wish he would have went harder on emails in the cyber security section.
I think we broke the ceiling in traffic.
He needs to be better prepared and know her striking points like her emails and Benghazi, next debate he should attack her on those subjects
We suspect your post is a troll post. Your post has been removed.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/The_Donald) if you have any questions or concerns.*
People that are saying he lost (cough /r/politics) don't understand how to win a debate. He ran that fucking room. He lead that entire debate. There was grilling, and tough questions on him (none on her, other than "emails, oops sorry"). But every time he pointed his finger, there was silence. That's what I'm voting for. Hillary can keep her transcript that she read tonight, I know she can sell it for a few hundred thousand.  Edit: This is how he won the primaries. Everyone is going to be talking about him, still.
I don't know who won, but I know Lester Holt lost.
My favorite part was "the election is up to you and your family"  Like we ever had a fucking choice. She's a snake.
[removed]
Liberal Cuckfisters are brigading this thread because they hate FACTS
Fuck Lester Holt.  FUCK HIM FUCK HIM FUCK HIM FUCK HIM FUCK HIM TO HELL
I think that poll stole my vote for Hillary but I am on iPad I dunno
He should have done better, but she really came across as very smug quite a few times, which didn't look good.  Trump got a few good hits in, but he should have hit harder.  He needs to polish his debating skills.   Nobody's going to be swayed one way or the other by this debate, but he needs to up his game.
She came on later in the debate. Trump crushed the first 45 minutes, thankfully. Lester Holt made sure Trump was on the defensive for the last 45. We heard nothing about the uranium deal from Lester. We heard nothing about Clinton's ties to the Saudis from Holt. We heard nothing about her aides smashing her phones from Holt. We heard nothing about her mishandling of classified information from Holt. We heard nothing about her diffusion of responsibility from Holt.   Trump handled it as well as he could. 
Trump would have if he pursued the email scandal. He had her right where he needed her with the cyber security topic but he ultimately wasted it. 
It was good. A bit biased as they never asked Hillary for specifics at all.  There was one good crazy Hillary head movement.
He didn't want to destroy her in the first debate. The last thing we need is a fresh new face subbed in for her! It's a marathon not a sprint.
TRUMP DESTROYED THAT LYING CUNT. ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER WOULD BE IF HE TEA BAGGED HER!  MAGA

Correct the record
HILLARYS QUESTIONS:  1. Whats your favorite color? 2. Do you not like Trump?
Ok, what was said?
This.  Fuck off with that CTR narrative.  Hillary was ready to go with whatever questions were directed to her.  She had a couple talking points that were lies ready to go for responses like the birtherism one.  Blumenthal spawned it, she agreed, and her interns ran with it in 2007.  Don't let anyone question otherwise, facts are facts.
[removed]
wtf are you talking about? there was the one posted by DJT himself, it has over 20k comments
Was expecting slaughter. But I wonder how effective these debates are in swaying voters. Everyone who has already decided has just heard what they needed to hear.
Oh sorry I misunderstood! Sad night sorry!
I want one!
Exactly!!!   I guess we're going to have to wait for Chris Wallace to question Hillary's record.
Link to the poll...
Why do you think? Also he's from PBS
Lord of the Shitpost, I love it!
I thought Trump faltered for the first 5 minutes...then he absolutely destroyed the cunt for the rest of the debate.  I decided to watch it without any outside influence (Shapiro/Crowder) and was being very even.   I thought she was awful 
[deleted]
he needs to look presidential. He is up, he cant go for the kill yet
Kinda what I am thinking...I think he did well, I think she was atrocious...same old rhetoric non words/sentences from Hiliary.  I think the you've had 30 years to do something, where is it is going to resonate with a lot of Americans. 
#WHY IS THIS AT ONLY 2 UPVOTES?!
It's unbelievable that 0 minutes were spent talking about her emails considering the topic of cyber warfare.
http://time.com/4506217/presidential-debate-clinton-trump-survey/?xid=homepage vote vote
If you look at any other article they are laughably silly. If he can't mock someone without people losing their shit, that's a problem. 
Neither woj, honestly. It was a shitshow. Donald came across as unprepared, and the mod was CLEARLY fucking biased. No Bengazi, no Foundation, and NO FUCKING EMAIL questions
[deleted]
Guys keep this thread high, the vote is turning to Trump quickly!! 
racist... oh wait, nvm. she could go after him on his taxes, oh wait, he said he'd release them when she opens up about her emails. oh wait she said he is hiding something in his taxes. does that mean she's hiding something in her emails? ... what about birtherism, oh wait, hillary started that. woman card there we go. no hillary you already played that one.
Thank God no one in real life actually reads this site.
I have a feeling something big is about to be leaked following this, I mean wasnt the buzz that something was coming out on the 26th?
[deleted]
which is good. he will fight more later, hes getting the audience comfortable with him first.
ABC cut off Trump interview after one question - and they bitched about him not showing up to the interview fast enough in the first place
Damn straight, i could see from the first opening salvo that Lester was softballing it in for hillary, while grilling Donald. Very unfair, should have simply asked the question, then left it alone until time ran out in each segment.

Yeesh.  So much concern trolling going on.  He did fine.  He appeared presidential.  He showed he could debate in an orderly fashion.    Hillary still looked like a smug condescending bullet point regurgitating bitch 
Yeah, if you [change the Location, and the name of the organization](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18923).  What do you think the new names would be???
Were we watching the same debate? That was the most biased moderation I HAVE EVER WITNESSED.
I've done 3. Stay involved and GET THEM OUT!
As Scott says,  Trump is great at persuasion. Tonight he set the ground work. The next 2 debates he'll fly. 
He directly asked Trump three pointed questions about controversial topics. That's fine, it's fair game. However, you have to do the same for her. That's what makes it unfortunate. Thankfully, seems like most people saw that and again, Hillary is hoping to damage Donald, not promote herself. 
 The questions were so tilted. At least two of Donald's questions were just allegations  She got given first response to every genuine question apart from use of nuclear first strike, to play into the media rumors that he will use nuclear force irresponsibly. absolute madnesss
I think he did good. I didnt hear him, and when he did speak it was to the structure of the debate or to move it along. I hated some of the questions, because they were not presidential, but liberal talking points I do not find important.
As much as I hate Hillary, I think to the generic public, Hillary won this debate. Trump missed some easy attacks on Hillary's political history and he tried to make himself the victim in to many remarks.
DJT missed a huge opportunity in this segment. He's not a politician but he's learning. Hope he can hammer her on this point and others in the next debate.
He participated in all the Republican debates.
You should be
As a southern centipede, this is certified creole level spicy. 
Pumped for the next round of Hillary BTFO, so much more ammo left in the magazine.
Clinton is a robot, talking points with no substance. I'll take someone who actually cares about the country please. 
I mean I think people expect hillary to be suave and well spoken, she is a lawyer and a career politician.   I think he really popped her bubble by saying that she has experience, but it is bad, and that she has been in politics for 30 years but incomes haven't gone up. 
Trump is pacing himself. With each debate he will become stronger. He will pull out all the major stops in the last debate. that will be the one on every voter's mind on election day. He was testing the waters and still managed to hold his own against a corrupt system. 
On the ropes! Next debate - gloves off!   No brakes!
What are they saying?
He was trying out the calm and collected Trump and I think it could've worked out better, but it didn't do anything devastating. I guarantee next debate will be more on the offensive rather than damage control.
He didn't get a chance to articulate. Most 2 minute segments were 75% spent diffusing Holt's and Hillary's attacks, which was necessary.  Trump stole the first 45 minutes, for sure.

TRUMP OWNED THE ESTABLISHMENT
Yeah.... the people want a vision for a better future. Not this petty complaining. 
I counted 3 targeted attacks by (Mo)lester Holt:  -  1) Pressing Trump on his tax returns  2) Pressing Trump on questioning Obama's birth certificate  3) Referencing Trumps previous quotes about women   -  Not to mention Holt constantly cutting Trump off to move to the next topic.  Seems to me that the topic switch should have been done equally on both sides.   This shit was so biased its almost comical.

#OUT OUT OUT  #SHILL GTFO
I think Trump did just fine. Showed his temperament and soften side that nuclear is indeed our biggest threat. He needed to attack her more on her emails and Benghazi but he did attack her on her failed experience. IMO attacking her failed experience works better than same old email attacks that average voter has heard many times.  Also debate moderator was clearly out to get Trump. Hillary was smiling every time Holt interrupted trump. He also helped Hillary huge by questions about woman and race baiting.   Overall not much negative happened and looking forward to continuous trend. I doubt this debate changed any minds. Zero effect on either side. 
I agree. I think it was pretty even but he was a little too defensive. Honestly I think he was holding back a lot, he has so much ammo to drop but there's two more debates yet and he couldn't blow his load too early. There were some great moments tonight though and some of the cheers Trump got from the crowd were awesome. VERY high energy.

 I agree - for what he did and said, I have no complaints. It's what he didn't say that he could have done better. 
Is it ever not?
Let them take this W guys. It doesn't matter in the long run. No one voting for Trump is going to switch sides to Clinton. Clinton supporters may just switch sides to Trump though, maybe not tonight, but eventually. 
He did have many opportunities to attack her.  She was obviously being helped tonight, but I know he'll adjust fire and come back.  Remember she's been doing this for 30 years, he's learning; trial by fire.
Hilary just gave a press conference, Trump had to debate two people. Fuckin rigged.

I thought it was a wash.  I as a little disappointed in the Donald as he didn't quite go in for the kill sometimes, and he also rambled on too long about the birth certificate.  He had her on the ropes with NAFTA, emails, Libya, and then just sort of let them go.
lol,   i have wrestled with a few who consider it a 'win' just drag you into their own shitty pigpen.
I'm not even CTR, I recently posted about how I've been a fan of Donald trump since the 2nd or 3rd grade. I just don't know if I could call either of them the winner. It was rough, just especially so for Trump.
Nobody goes to a Trump rally to say "Hey! This guy's gonna lose!". This sub is a Trump rally, so do as you would do at a Trump rally. If you've never been to one, though, they've got all sorts of things: chicks, Pepe, MAGA. They've got the best stuff, folks.
&gt; Trump was so clear and transparent today.  Dude, Trump said paying zero in federal taxes is "smart".  You call that transparent?  They're both fucking corrupt.

There's been a lot of shit being said about the trump foundation lately and that wasn't brought up.  But he didn't go after her uranium sales to Russia, 20% of our stock while she bashes on Trump'ssupposed ties to Russia.  She did successfully bait him a few times.  He basically admitted to paying no fed tax by replying "that's because I'm smart" that'll rub some people the wrong way.   Her insults were weak though, she used the "Trumped up trickle down economics" twice to no response from the audience who did react to certain bits.
I think he wasn't as aggressive as I would have liked. But the point is that this isn't about me, it's about the 20 percent undecided in the middle.   Those folks would be turned off by Trump being unnecessarily mean to Hillary. They want somebody presidential, and Trump gave them that.   The email thing? The daily drumbeat of pleading of the Fifth and immunity deals tells folks that it is shady as hell. I'd love to see him nail her to the wall. But if he loses the middle doing it, we win a battle but lose the war.
I hope you're right. He could have hammered her on the emails, on the Foundation corruption, on her entire history.   I just wish he had specifically said that Iran will get the nuke if she is President, just like N Korea got the nuke when Bill was President.   Disastrous. 
Relax lads. He did a fine job. He spoke directly to the people that matter... the folks in PA, OH, IL...   The minorities in inner cities......  He also spoke to the Bernie bros. he brought up DWS.
You forgot Lester "whispered" it to hiliary tentatively...like when waking up his senile grandmother. 
What else is new
I'm really disappointed in Trump at the debate...  Not once did he mention the wall and that Mexico was going to pay for it!!!!!!   ;)
Gotcha.
#TRUMP WILL POST THIS POLL TOMORROW! KEEP VOTING CENTIPEDES!!!!
Yep, what a joke.  Trump should have been better prepared but that was a horrible debate... 
ok
Hillary definitely ran out of energy at the end. There where a couple of times where she was left exasperated and would make some joke or comment to the crowd when she would start speaking in order to stall for time. 
It's a lie, a simple attempt to disarm people who claim that he's helping Hillary.

Thats exactly what it was. That was totally loaded so that,w hen they steal the election, they can point to that video and tell him that he'd accept whoever won.

CNN poll:  Hillary Clinton 104%  Donald Trump 0.02%
Maybe for 20 seconds on the emails? But that's OK let's blast trump on taxes etc.  Where was the questions on the Clinton Foundation?
The Hill poll has Trump ahead by just 2%...get over there to vote!  http://thehill.com/homenews/news/297924-poll-who-won-the-debate
I think trump purposefully was wild. It almost seemed like he was pushing it on purpose. Think there is some 4d chess at play....hes thinking 10 steps ahead.
Some of it's legitimate I'm sure.  I've dedicated a lot of to Trump, as I know many of us have, but he's not a practiced politician or debater.  And that's fine, I don't want a political puppet who quotes policy and always speaks with eloquence, I was someone who takes charge, is brutally honest with the country and actually cares about Americans.  And that person is Donald Trump.
Scroll thru and vote in every poll you see:  https://twitter.com/search?q=poll&amp;src=typd
How ingenious is bragging about your failures
Bingo that was my point as well. While being able to competently discuss policy...He was quite composed for a Trump debate considering all the nonsense Hillary was spewing, and still hit her hard on policy issues, rather than personal issues. (which are really devastating to Hillary, but he's definitely saving it)
Right, my thought exactly!!

A master of words.
Exactly, he was going for Candy Crowly moment on asking about taxes, trying to pin the Iraq war on him, saying he said Hillary doesn't look like a president. I don't remember Hillary getting any questions like that.
Not anymore.

This poll started at 33k votes with 68% going to hillary minutes after the debate ended. Now that people actually started voting it's up to 300k+ and Trump is ahead - the people speak again! MAGA
This seems like the most likely result
Rigged!!!!
Quick - to the campaign plane, where they have to drag her and dump her in. 
Open incognito they seem to block referrals from reddit for their vote counting
? Trump is winning in just about all of the polls now
And the Daily Beast...no surprise there.
Put the link. 
Here is the thing:  I'm college aged and my friends are huge liberals.  Tonight at my house there were 6 of us watching the debate and every time Trump started talking they would start interrupting and finding any excuse to disagree or insult him.  Every time I would have to tell them to shut the fuck up.  After the end of the debate, we all had a conversation.  To make a long story short:  Trump's conduct and lack of controversy during the debate allowed them to be open to my points about him.  Now half of them are straight up on the fence and saying that they probably won't vote.  So, because my liberal friends had never really payed too much attention to Trump until it was shoved in their face, and because Trump was always straw-manned and attacked so heavily, he is now in a position where some minds can actually be changed.    (This is of course purely anecdotal.)

'Fair' questions such as:  "Donald, are you more of a racist or a sexist?"  or  "Madam Secretary, with all due respect, will you fix the economy or foreign relations first?"  Dishonest media!

He was fighting the moderator on every question and thr moderator would have let Hillary get away with literally stabbing Trump.
He lost but I am not worried. He needed a lesson and he got it. Meanwhile, she used all her ammo and he has a huge untapped depot of nukes. I'd rather lose the first one and win the last two then the other way around
The media would've praised her regardless. Trump could've dominated and the media would say "Strong female Hillary stands up to the sexist patriarch Trump"  Trump didnt mention the Clinton's personal stuff because as you said, this was a knife fight. That is a nuke.   Trump did win best sound byte of the night, in my opinion. "You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just now coming up with these solutions?" What a hit.
I knew something was fucky. Good eye centipede.

They are censoring us. Upvotes are not being counted here. On the night of the first debate, this is NOT a coincidence.

I wanted to see Trump flatten her in the debate like a steamroller.  I was ready for her to keel over like she did on 9/11.  A coughing fit would have been nice.   I hoped she would vomit up a frog or two. But I'm a rabid Trump supporter who wants to see Hillary in Prison.  Maybe he's trying to appeal to some undecideds by going easy on her?  For me, personally, I felt he let her off way too easily.   When Lester brought up cyber security, I would have asked about 13 blackberries and destroying them with hammers.  I'm wondering why he let her wriggle off the hook like that?
Just want to point out when I voted a hour ago Trump was down by 7 pts, the power of The_Donald folks.

Are you kidding?  The American people saw through her charade. She lost.
You know that this is an open source thing you can see. There's not some conspiracy, you can literally look at the code of the website and see what it's doing
Lester's no fool... He knows he's overpaid and dependent on Democrats to keep his job.
You nailed it. They're scared.  He didn't go off half cocked. Yes, he was defensive, but he was being assaulted by the moderator and his opponent. I imagine he thought that maybe Lester wouldn't low ball him like he did, but he did. Those questions were obviously written by HRCs team. HRC was giddy and smugg knowing the questions before hand it seemed and her answers seemed scripted.

I believe in both Trump and his policies. He's pragmatic which imo transcends party lines. Something we need is someone who can go past the 2 party system while still working under one of the major parties. He has the support he would never have as a 3rd party candidate.
True..  But I still do not think Hillary won...   She came off as really kind of a smug bitch..   
He needs to elaborate faster, not more. Get to the point man you look like an ass - was my feeling half the time. 
**AGAIN**
I appreciate your ability to keep it real. I wish the left had more people like you. 
What's amazing is that the email issue and the Clinton Foundation were barely mentioned....Trump will go HAM on those issues in the next debate!
Careful, son, your cuck is showing.
He was **WINNING SO MUCH** for the first 25 minutes when they were actually talking about economic policy and shit.  Then Lester turned it into the Donald Trump show and brought up every embarrassing quote or incident from the last 40 years while Hillary stood there cackling, happy she didn't face one single question about her scandals or character.

She's really not though. he's biding his time. he didn't want to blow his load all at once in the first debate. 
**BUY PEPE!**
I wished he would have hammered the fuck out of her. I thought he was too soft. 
Trump missed many great opportunities tonight but this will only give some fodder for the MSM to fondle themselves over into COMPLACENCY the coming days. Watch now for sudden D+20 polls shifting in her direction. BUT THIS WILL CEMENT THE DONALD'S UNDERDOG STATUS. She used up all her ammo, even the pithy personal attacks. I think we were too caught up in the 'winning' - there's many twists and turns yet. The trend is with Trump and we have yet to see Julian Assange's wikileaks drop. Still more debates to bring that shit up.
I believe Hillary knew the tax one was coming. The way she smirked.

Welcome aboard the Trump train!
I can't believe Clinton said 400 pound nerds go around hacking people, what a disgrace she is.
hah. Well I have to be able to watch it raw, so I watched it on c-span. they had a constant side by side camera setup that was great
Hillary spent more time attacking Trump than she did presenting her supposed mastery of knowledge.  Thats what CBS pundits said.  Even they said she didnt win  and they have always been agais t trump.   Trump masterfully presented the truth  against the lies she tossed and for many people that was the first time they had heardthe truth so it was important.  She was a robot.  
I love how he calls **a** woman a pig and suddenly it's an assault on all women. Can't insult anyone without insulting everyone that fits their identity politics subculture anymore?
[removed]
I prefer to watch all of the networks. 
Fuck yo couch.  Take that.
He did what he needed. The debate is a wash, fine. But for long term, Trump needed to know how her attacks, and he got them. She laid out all her cards, Trump didn't.
Very true,  No reason to drum up war over some hacked corruption
It's gonna backfire so hard for them. Seeing Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump post after post. People will catch on or get bored with the repetitive content, dull points, and pedantic nature of it all.
HIS NAME WAS HARAMBE
Brb, I love my girlfriend so much that I'm going to give her irish sunglasses since she just scolded me for leaving the toilet seat up
I have been sick all day...hugging the toilet sick...as I watched the debate I was energized. Finally, someone was calling out that old hag on her role in creating ISIS. Even with the moderator giving her extra time and trying to nail Trump with gotcha questions, Trump's energy and enthusiasm overwhelmed her canned, planned, and bland answers. He is gaining momentum, as always. 
I think one should keep in mind that this is the first time MANY people are actually watching Trump in a debate and not just the editorized clips droned out by MSM. So his strategy of not coming swinging in the opening day is arguably sound.  There are two more coming up. Wikileaks etc. Lot of ammo to attack on policies. Personal attacks are not going to win over people who have already made up their mind that Trump is just a mean bully who doesn't know facts. Their ideology should be systematically deconstructed.

See, Trump seems defensive because he defends himself against accusations like a normal person would. Hillary does the typical politician move where instead of defending herself on a topic she doesn't like, or explaining herself, she just ignores it so that it passes by faster. Take the DNC rigging the primary against Bernie Sanders that Trump mentioned. No follow-up from Hillary because she *does not* want that being discussed. Ditto on Libya, on Benghazi, on the emails, on the server. She just wants to smile and laugh it off and then repeat her same stale lines from the '90s about "investing in the middle class".   I get why politicians do this though because it's kind of a smart move - just ignore the attack so the topic collapses - but what happens when you're up against someone who *isn't* a politician and *will* defend himself? I think in a way people like that Trump is always so willing to explain himself or contest every accusation, even the minor ones, because it seems like he actually cares what the voters think. Like even if he wasn't running for President he would really really want you to know the full story and what actually happened in any given scenario. Hillary has more of a *the-voters-are-so-beneath-me-I-won't-even-bother-to-address-this* attitude. 
This is completely true.

The only thing that they have that says Trump supported the war was him saying, "I guess". But a week after the war started Trump was quoted as saying "That war is a mess."
He started talking about Parkinsons meds and the side effects and some affiliates cut to another program with 40% as good of ratings.
Agreed. Trump let Hillary get under his skin too much and lost control of the discussion. Really unfortunate, because Clinton got off way too easily and all her hard questions were brushed under the rug without much effort.

I couldn't watch the debate real time but I loved that he called her out on her "super predator" comments
Yeah we were all hoping for a little more bloodshed. Hillary only attacked like once, and acted like she was the "calm" one when Trump was defending himself.  When they both start yelling, we'll see sparks fly. But I've seen her in the primary debates, and she doesn't go offensive much and is too generalistic to criticize.
I was more taking it from the perspective of "I would do it differently if I could redo it, so that I wouldn't have gotten caught." Now here's what confuses me... What is the benefit of her using a private email? She knows she wasn't supposed to do it, but what was her motive? Am I missing something?
From my experience I would say that it's actually an inconvenience to the coworkers. In most cases that I've seen the coworkers just get the person on maternity leave's work dumped on. Temps are not always hired. It sucks but how it is.

(Is your username a "The League" reference?)  I agree. Personally, I don't know if it would have been different had He gone full on [Crush Her!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbI8aGagJC4), in this debate instead of the more restrained persona he's exhibiting tonight.   But a lot of the pundits have said, in this FIRST debate (and there are still 2 more to go, folks) as long as he stays cool and reasonable, he will have succeeded.
A gift from overseas?  Melania has a number of single cousins flying in?  Someone is defecting from Saudi Arabia and has information about Huma, hillary and Harambe?  
Think of it this way: Trump is the last train to civilization. If the USA misses it, it won't end overnight, but it would be  aimless and endangered. It is a matter of survival to elect Donald Trump.   Now we don't have to convince ourselves: we have to make sure we've registered and WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OTHERS HAVE. We have to vote AND WE HAVE TO CONVINCE OTHERS TO VOTE.   This is about reaching out. Voice your opinion. Face the shillarys. Talk to the undecided, the skeptic, the uninformed, everyone.  Some people think voting Trump is just about a better economy and more personal safety for all segments of society. It is all that, but what's at stake is more crucial: it's the survival of the USA and its citizens regardless of personal identity. After 8 long years of Obama, a Hillary government would mean turning the US into a nation of families without future and fear without end.
Chelsea is a big girl. Shouldn't have mattered. 
No doubt you're right, I'm sure she doesn't give a damn about any member of any of the groups of people she panders to. And I'm sure that all of her """preparation""" for the debate was an endless re-rehearsal of various focus-group-tested lines, all as genuine as astroturf.  If I could stand listening to Hillary's voice and her da-DAAAH-da-DAAAH-da-DAAAH cadence, I'd watch the video. (but I can't)

But what you are calling for is a diversion from what we should be focusing on. You want to get #redditcensoring trending when you should be getting something pro-Trump trending. And yes censorship is bad, but that shouldn't be the focus. I'm just saying why distract from Trump post debate with a frivolous attempt to get #redditcensoring trending?!?
This is why you always pay robot unions. 
You don't in the general.  Any declaration of party would be for the primaries.

You could see her eyeballs nearly pop out when he went there. That was a great moment!
Media coverage is part of it, The border wall sounding impractical, the temporary banning on Muslims he proposed, when I found out about his thoughts on climate change, him not releasing his tax returns, and calling Hillary Clinton insulting names like crooked Hillary instead of using legitimate arguments to attack her messed up positions and blatant lies. That's all that comes to my mind for right now. The only thing Trump has sold me on is some of his Economic plans(I haven't heard all of them yet).

I thought so but idk. Bernie fans saw the same smug dismissing sociopath that Bernie dealt with. Her act was phonier than a Folex watch. Her fake smile and dismissive laughs covering up her anger were pretty obvious.  I think people have been more keen on this, especially the berners. I'm glad he lashed out on her TPP flip flops.  He did tend to revert to talking points though. He was nervous as was she but she made a career of putting on an act.  Thing is she didn't cough, collapse, or anything and that was  a selling point for many. But more than ever, her phoniness shown. He really was trying to be presidential, he knows his supporters have his back. He's reaching for the undecided casual voter and he did ok with that.  He spoke out, put Lester in his place a few times. I think she'll get a slight bump in the polls but remember most aren't enthusiastic about her. If you don't vote, then it doesn't matter what you think.
Thank you for doing a fantastic job of covering Trump on the trail, RSBN!

Haven't seen the debate yet... this was a good read.  On My way home NPR kept calling Hillary a 'happy warrior' and said she overperformed.   Based on how the questions were framed I can see why it would appear that way -- dirty tricks.  
[removed]
CRUNCH WRAP
I think Trump came out on top overall, but for me it was too close a call. Hillary was more aggressive and Trump more defensive than I anticipated. I think the key isn't Trump getting in "good lines" as much as it is him NOT falling for Hillary's virtue-signaling and empty accusations to the extent that he did tonight. You don't need to spend a full minute explaining the reality of a class-action law suit from 50 years ago; not when it only took your opponent 5 seconds to unload on you. Trump tries, often successfully, to plough through his opponents' obfuscation, but he's dealing with a moralless lawyer who is also a career politician; despite her practical uselessness, Hillary (and the army of sickly goblins that runs her campaign) knows how to craft baited traps out of language. Essentially, Hillary knows that trolling is a art, and she's a true master ruse man. How do you win against a troll? You don't. If you egage their challenge seriously, you've already been trolled. How do you win against Hillary's endless baseless accusations? You don't. If you treat them seriously, you make them sound legitimate. IMO, Trump's approach to the truly BASELESS and SLANDEROUS jabs should be to stop meeting them head-on and instead deconstruct/challenge the integrity of the argument itself; whenever Hillary's charges against him are sophistry, he should treat them like sophistry. Most importantly, every second Trump spends wrestling with Hillary's phantasmagoric horseshit is a second he spends OFF the attack. Which is where he ought to be at least 70% of the time. What fable could she possibly make stick to him, if he were to always brush it off and fire back with one of the many REAL atrocities she's committed? The fact that a woman who has let American citizens die on her watch, rigged her primaries, and handled highly classified government memes with less guile than a middle schooler offers his porn folder can get away with accusing ANYONE of ANYTHING is itself laughable.   tldr (also didn't format); tonight I watched a talented businessman argue with a talented politician. What I hope to see next time: an honest man standing up to a liar. A selfless person chiding a greedy person. A man of action ripping into a rhetorician. I don't want to see them navigate through each other's talking points; I want to see them expose and assault each other's views until they get down to naked ideology. One of them will fall apart under scrutiny, and the other will not. Any policy is secondary; all that actually matters (to me) is that our leader's ideology, not their rhetorical constructs, stand up to the harshest criticism. Trump's does. Hillary's doesn't, and that's why her campaign is about misdirection and hyper-aggressive accusation; if Trump ever got a chance to REALLY, publicly hit back, her credibilty would vanish. That's the only point worth making, because it's the most fundamental truth.

He did get [60% in the CNBC after poll] (https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/780644145492877312) 
&gt;The truth is none of the tax returns she is talking about have ever been released, and she's ignoring other returns examined by New Jersey gambling regulators showing that Trump did pay taxes. The evidence is in a 1981 report that analyzed Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex.  &gt;The report, on Page 33, details Trump's income and federal tax payments for 1975 through 1979.  &gt;The report states that Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years to the tune of $71,932 on reported income of $219,334. (In current dollars, that would be a $296,121 paid in taxes on $910,319 in reported income.)  &gt;In the final two years he did not pay federal income taxes because, according to tax rules, he lost money each year — more than $3.8 million then, or about $12.8 million today.  &gt;New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement verified his income, losses and deductions. The division said Trump's losses came from the operation of his various properties. But the report offers no specifics. We asked both the Clinton and Trump campaigns if they had any additional information since our original check. We didn't hear back.

idk. I'd like her to explain. And I'd like her to explain why she tried to steal the china.
in all fairness to Holt he was given a script to read. he was probably given marching orders to include certain things

And wasn't advertised on twitter or Facebook... 
I'm a little confused as to why Trump didn't go her throat when the topic of cyber security came up.   He could've easily shed light on her giving away classified information in a number of bigly ways.  Maybe he was instructed to pull punches until a further debate?  He even said outright at the end he would withhold a comment.  Either way it was a win for Trump! I expect polls to continue with the general shift in his direction.
Shhhhhh. Don't ruin the joke!!!
The dog ate my....never mind.
Damn, she has a nice set of titties!
He also declined to ask her supporters to compose themselves the whole debate after telling the crowd to not cheer after a Trump response.
Never finish shooting your load during the first round.
It'd be nice if they could speak longer than 2 min with constant interruption. The commander in chief was nice for that reason. He can get into more detail.

He can do better than he did. Rubio and Cruz were chumps bullied into submission. The media and roughly half the country are backing up Hillary, it's going to be a bigger challenge, she can't drop out, unless she literally drops (could happen again).  I agree that she's not an inspiring debater at all, but she's in control of herself 100% of the time. No smiling by accident, no laughing by accident. Trump is more genuine, but also more rambling - this is likeable, but not helpful in a debate where the moderator is out to get you.
That is over 3 per second, damn.  That's some serious high energy right there 
EXACTLY. He was trying to show he has temperment to be presidential. People will look at him and think he's not Hitler, and they can get on board instead of throwing their votes away because they hate Hillary. 
sounds like el rato-levels of cadences...el rato won't be called cruz unless he actually votes in the senate for all of donald's plans as president
Kek. But why isn't she 50 points ahead?!
Michael Moore is the biggest (no pun intended (or maybe it was)) piece of hypocritical trash going. He hates capitalism but doesn't mind getting rich from it.
Im actually really disappointed he didn't pursue the cyber security issue with Hillary and the rampant corruption of the DNC and how poorly they are informed on cyber security and cyber terrorism/ hacking.He could have really pointed out how technologically behind the times she is and how that is scary how ignorant she is with technology. He could have really done her in and made her look completely incompetent. FAIL!

Be on the lookout for poll rigging by the media. The online ones from biased media have a habit of jumping the other way right before they're reported on.

Trump got to where he is today by being himself.  By not being himself, he wouldn't be winning all of these polls.  People can't expect that if he were humbler he would be polling better. People don't jump aboard the Trump Train because hes presidential, they do it because they want to MAGA and not sell out to globalists and today that's what he preached hard and that's why hes dominating all these polls.
I really hope Trump brings out the big guns in the next debates.

MAKE THIS ITS OWN POST
It's like the old saying about football that offense wins games but defense wins championships. He's on the offense and she's on the defense. Now that he knows what her defense is it's time to attack in the next quarter. Her weakness is that she can't be trusted. But he'll save that for the big touchdown pass in the third quarter. I'm curious what he'll do in the meantime. He has to score next time not just plan for a big finale. It's a game of inches. 3-0 Clinton.

time poll went from 60% trump to 50/50 in less than ten minutes. something fucked up is happening
Yeah there seems to be a lot of concern trolling or something. He handled himself very well. Imo he crushed the first half and then was just on the defensive for second half. If anything at all this debate showed people who have never watched a debate that he can stand on stage and hold his own without letting his temper take over.  And some people are upset he didn't prepare more when he was actually going out and speaking to the people where she just memorized lines that were polled.  
She said it when Trump obviously lied, two easy concrete examples are about global warming, and supporting the Iraq war. Here he is supporting the war https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77P6fxa2KOs, saying he hoped it worked the first time. There are many easily findable tweets that are him saying Global Warming is a hoax.   One time Trump used the phrase "fact check" during the debate was about killings in NY, he said they are going up and that we should fact check it to see that he was telling the truth.   According to the NYPD, he was lying https://twitter.com/JPeterDonald?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw  You can't blatantly lie over and over again and then get offended when people tell you to fact check your statements. 
Pretty sure he was saying shes been a mental child until fairly recently
Yes. 
Yeah the bias was super obvious. It's probably good for Donald, smart undecided people will easily recognise it and it goes to show that he is right about being anti-establishment. 
Once he brought conflict of interest into it I think a non partisan perspective has to bring up the crappy foundation and directed at clinton from her time.
WEAPONIZED AUTISM
Not post-debate. They didn't ask that late.

It's part of her debate strategy. Smile and act like everything her opponent says is ridiculous.
This is like half life 3 times 10000000!
/r/AskThe_Donald is what you're looking for I think.   But the biggest thing is appointing another liberal judge to the SCOTUS.   That could possibly open up anti-2A and anti-1A legislation down the road; IE: hate speech laws like the UK, which is whatever the government deems hate speech. It's a way to maintain political control.  She's also bought and paid for. Proof is in the whole clinton foundation pay for play stuff, I suggest watching clinton cash.  Her foundation also ran off with a lot of money donated towards the Haiti earth quake relief effort.  Her and her cronies will continue to keep the corruption going, while they get rich and make you poorer.

Bro, he won the first 15 min or so then he just defended himself the entire time.  He didn't go after too hard about the emails, the Clinton foundation, the rigged DNC and how they rigged it against Bernie, etc.  He defended himself.  He would start making solid points then go off on a tangent.  It was extremely disappointing.  I feel a lot of you guys are allowing bias to get in the way.  He lost this debate.  He was honestly terrible.  He took too much time trying to defend himself when he could have attacked her.
Very I would say.  Nate said if he gets a bump out of this he cant be stopped.
She flat out lied about trade and emails
I think the reality is, Clinton is so corrupt and so evil, that the only way Trump could "win" in their mind is if it played out like the end to a revenge movie, where its just complete cathartic power and destruction against something you've grown to hate so much. The Trump win is vindication of an unrealistic proportion to what Clinton deserves. Those that support Trump aren't at risk of supporting Clinton but those that support Clinton do so at the mercy of their portrayal of Trump, which was mega super Hitler, so him not coming across as such could be seen as a win, perhaps even a strategic lob. 
We are fighting a rigged system.  
Of course he wants Trump to win.  Then he gets attention from the little firestorms he creates.  With a liberal President, the whole country is already burning.  
That CNN poll was D+10 as reported later. Slate, Fortune, CNBC polls all show Trump winning.  If you want a more scientific poll take the D+5 Breitbart/Gravis poll. Clinton beats Trump only 48-43. And Trump gained a net 2% from undecideds in that poll. Also Trump beat Hillary in plausability 46-42.  In this poll they polled voters before and after the debate for accuracy.
Ive openly supporter him around here and its amazing how many people Ive heard from that support him but are afraid to openly do so in fear of losing friends or being attacked.

I felt that the silenced audience was really unnecessary. Trump obviously does better during rallies when he can keep the crowd's energy high and there was no chance of that. 
Piggy Backing:  Trump 100% won this debate guys. For the informed voter that is.  100% of Hillary's answers were complete bullshit and I refuted them every time. She answers with bad statistics, lies, and platitudes.  Job Growth? We haven't recovered our jobs.        Taxes? Taxes are the bane of a modern economy and always have been.          Losses in 2008? Those "Trillions Lost" were Trillions lost in FAKE inflated WEALTH. And not a comparison to the normalization before the bubble. She made good things look better, and bad things look worse.        No definitive answers. She was in full rehearsal mode.         Trump hasn't even started yet, he has a FULL team of advisers, and brilliant campaign heads.        Setting up a confirmation bias and the building on it is implicit to winning.      e: I would like to add that Trump really hurts himself by talking about issues and not explaining them.  He talks about the jobs in Mexico, but not that the products come back to the US TAX FREE in trucks not up to standards, which are sold to the same Middle class these companies are selling out, and it's literally a transfer of nation wealth into these corporations pockets.  He does this on many issues, which is unfortunate.  He missed Hillary voting for the wars, her departments dismissal of companies violating embargoes and sanctions (in exchange for foundation donations), and other issues, to the point where I wish I could debate for him lol.

At this point, Trump will win even if he didn't speak a single word! 
My girlfriend, who doesn't pay much attention to politics, watched with me last night and she couldn't believe how biased the moderator was against Trump.  She also said that Hillary answered a lot of the questions like a robot with rehearsed little speeches while Trump seemed real. I think that a lot of normies think the same.

Are these Facebook friend liberals?

We need to get the weaponized autists of 4chan investigating this. 
You know he didn't do what the media expected him to do and instead was aggressive. I like that. 
Never. There's no advantage.  If Trump wins, the Bush family is over, politically speaking.   If Trump loses, then a belated knee-bending is of no use.   Contrast to Cruz, who still has a political career to salvage. 
Well she's a bitch , it's all her supporters fault she's not 50 points ahead . 
This issue alone proves that facts do not mean shit to the left. They keep pushing what they know is a lie to mobilize women into voting against an injustice that does not exist. 
NJ.com and slate?!?? Big league.

You could certainly be right. I'd just like Hillary to be exposed even more for the fraud she is. All talk and no action unless it's in her own self interest. 
Kind of like Kasich in the primaries. For awhile, he was fourth place in a two man race. Cruz and Rubio, who had both dropped out before Kasich, had more delegates than him when he was still in the race.
That notepad was supposed to a blank sheet of paper to jot notes on during the debate. I never really saw her writing much down during the debate.

you're ruining this sub with click bait titles
Nice work OP that's a nice picture you made
His wife reposted a video on Facebook on Sept 23 where Bernie says not to listen to him if he tells them to vote for someone else.  it was in a television interview several months ago. It's in this sub somewhere. I'll see if I can find it. 
And Trump is still leading the TIME poll.  Must be frustrating for all the pundits who claim that Hillary won to have every single online poll (apart from CNN) showing Trump won. Trump was presidential, while Hillary failed to rattle him or take him down.   CBS, TIME, CSNBC, and so on. Slate is not a particularly conservative site (to put it mildly) and their poll shows Trump winning. Even Michael Moore says Trump won.
This is making me think he should have called her out on CTR when she was talking about her "fact checkers",...-"Oh, you meant the people who need to be paid to pretend to like you on the Internet?".
Well he does get some action prepping the bull.
It sounded like she was on the acceptance stage of the 10 part process.
When Lester mentioned Tax returns all I though was here come the emails 
&gt; I don't understand why Trump didn't call out Lester Holt DURING the debate  Because it was too subtle for most people. If you haven't noticed, his mic had more problem than hers, and his camera was shaking, while her was static.
I'm one of 4 Republicans (in the Republican club) on an incredibly liberal campus and I must say, whenever professors bring up lefties ideals, I am the first to come back at them with statistics and logic. They come back with emotionally fueld bull shit and that's the difference between the two parties. It is so evident in this video (although fair disclaimer, I don't know the context of the dispute or what class this is or the discussion topic)
Holt is a registered Republican.

They tweeted something last night in regards to "here are the 33000 emails, but what looked like a link innthatbtweet, wasn't really a link. 
My father is a politician in my country, and while he had to wait for me to translate what I could from the debate (I was doing an awful job translating Hillary's), he said the same thing, her answers were as generic as they could be.
If they were going to spill the questions they wouldn't need to send an intern.  A phone call would do the trick faster and with less trace.

Never mind, was answered further down 
I like how even before i could reply to his comment (the CTR) it was deleted.  But since i still have it, i won't let it STAY deleted!   /u/bunt_cubbles said:  &gt;Funny you say that about the website cause Trump did the same thing, only his site DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING. Hillary had a fact checker on her site and Trump tried to one up her saying his did too. It did not have a live fact checker.
I don't think dean knows how terrible and jittery people who do blow look
I listened to a national radio station last night, and everyone but one guy that called in said it was Trump.   No shit, the "Republican" that called in to say Hillary won stuttered the whole time when pressed for why he thought so.   CNN and all the MSM may say Hillary won, but everyone saw the truth for themselves 
This is correct. I don't see that as a reason to spare her, but that is why Trump is so much better a person than I am. 
I'm pretty sure that poll was prepared in advance.  
It wasn't Hillary, it was Holt. He didn't get under his skin. He just kept interrupting him, putting him on the defence, and making him correct lies. One of the worst was when Holt insisted 3 times that Trump supported the Iraq war before it started.  It was well knows Trump didn't support the war. Hannity confirmed that in a recent tweet. Trump also made headlines when he made a point of it at a Republican debate... since he basically said Bush lied to us. Took some balls to say that about a former Republican President at a Republican primaries debate!
Yeah. Well I'm one guy. Just my opinion. It's too bad all of us minorities can't just consolidate all of our vote around one, simple, unifying topic... Oh wait that's identity politics! Hahaha

And Donalds bitch.
I think Mr. Trump did very well in this debate despite his lack of political experience. I saw true concern for the state of America. I saw honest desire to begin fixing our govt and create accountability.    Now, BASED ONLY ON speech fluidity, wordsmithing and 30 yr worth of pushing political lies, clinton sounded better (I'm talking face value ONLY). And unfortunately her supporters are not intelligent enough to realize the many contradictions, lies, inability to address her illegal email activity, and my personal favorite- how she said her team turned her website into a fact checking database... The list goes on and on.     Sociopathic qualities- glibness and superficial charm.  Grandiose sense of self. Pathological lying. Lack of remorse, shame, guilt. Shallow or no emotions. Incapacity for love. Lack of empathy. Irresponsibility &amp; unreliability. Infidelity (this 1 for billy). Parasitic lifestyle. Criminal versatility. Authoritarian, secretive &amp; paranoid..... If this is not an accurate description of hrc, then this morning I took a handful of crazy pills instead of the usual 1 crazy pill. 
I went through the transcript and there were 4 topics introduced by Holt that were attacks on Trump. These topics all originated from Holt and were not prompted at all by anything any candidate said: Trump taxes, Trump 'support' of the iraq war, birtherism, 'presidential look'. These are fair questions fine but he introduced nothing directed at Clinton. The only thing Holt challenged Clinton on was asking Clinton to respond to Trump mentioning 'emails'.  So that's 4 to 0.  There were plenty of hard questions he could have ask.  Asking about pay for play at the state department, ask about Comey saying she was lying before congress, ask about Saudi donations to the Clinton Foundation.   He could have asked anything but ended up asking nothing at all.  This is a woman who went over 270 days without taking any questions at all from reporters and she gets off scott free in the debate.  Pathetic.
I'd love to but I simply don't have the time to stick around :(

This will call out the sham journalists on national broadcast.
It's a good thing, for the first time at least since 2008, we don't have a complete pansy for a candidate that will sit there and take it, or worse, apologize. Trump proved one thing (among others)- he doesn't take any shit from the dishonest media.   That moderator was complete shit; declaring Trump's positions incorrectly, and demanding he explain them. Hopefully enough undecideds or those with the possibility of being uncucked noticed.

Well, just read the comments in the sticky about the online polls.
Absolutely certain she did not write all that DURING the debate.  You found it folks!
Nah not at all this is a super old screen shot. But if you use res and zoom in it is very based. 
The reception he got for this debate is likely going to have him pace the intensity. 2nd debate won't be a blood bath. He'll save that for the 3rd.
Side bitch, lol.  Who's the main course, Huma?
At least when Trump paused, it was only when he was about to say her name. He needed to refrain from calling her Crooked and call her Secretary instead.
Holt just couldn't stump the Trump.
Oh, I definitely agree, and I felt like he did not go far enough some times.  I think it was kind of what you said though, there was just so much being thrown around at once for a bit there.
I wonder if some people see a sign like that and almost see it as an invitation?

The *really* fun part about this is that the next bought-out-moderator will realize he needs to step it up, and become VERY overbearing or risk being shut down like Lester. This boost in overbearingness will be more obvious than ever about the HRC bias and no-one will be able to pretend there's no bias. Besides HuffPo readers.

Clinton being a lizard doesn't drink water. Only reason its noticeable.
It's because liberals are all for "blacks, women and gays" (it's who they are all "fighting for"). When a gay man is racist towards a black woman, it then contradicts them and they have a paradox on their hands. Like the true robots they are, can't deal with a paradoxal situation.
Absolutely. 2016 has been the most violent year in a while. Thanks obama
I've said it before and ill say it again, Lester's one of the biggest race baiters on TV
It's like the unholy trinity, right there
He also mentioned wanting her to feel good. "That is important to me"
Perhaps this is the reason for Holt having to interrupt him so much?

The whole time she's talking, and I mean the WHOLE TIME she looks down "at her hands" but look carefully, she's reading.  Trump was on fire!
That's because he continued to go over time, and didn't answer the questions.

But these are exactly the issues that Donald wants to quash. He wants people to know he's not a racist and that he doesn't hate women. So wouldn't these questions be perfect for the nimble navigator? Why not look at this like-- they gave him an opportunity to quash all the bullshit. I am confused why people are upset at the questions. How else will America know how Trump feels, except from Trump himself?  Personally, if they wouldn't have mentions these things, I would have thought: they didn't give him the chance to quash the MSM bullshit! They didn't let him address the stupid racist accusations!  Somebody explain what we're upset about. I don't get it. We don't want Trump to clarify? 
hillary fans are willfully ignorant.

Miss Manners would NOT approve.   It is important to note he asked her for her preferred manner of address and offered "Secretary Clinton".  She should have refused, reminded him she is no longer in office, and does not hold that title.  It's Mrs. Clinton or Hillary.    He let her usurp a title she doesn't own, just like she isn't Her Royal Highness, etc.  TACKY.  She offered no courtesy in asking his preferred mode of address and spoke to him in the familiar in a very formal setting without permission.

If anyone wants an automatron running the country that could provide slick BS upon request, sleep 20 hours a day, collect money for her own pocket, and do nothing for the country why settle for Hitliary?  Disney could provide us with one that actually seems human at a much cheaper cost.
she was losing steam, focus and composure at the end. Also noticed her eyes were getting red and squinty. looks like when uppers start wearing off.
Yeah actually...that should be a thing. Also, if a man does a shitty job and his co-worker is a woman in the same position and she does an exceptional job..he shouldn't be paid as much as her either.
I love how Clinton's Trumped up trickle down comment came off so poorly. It was forced, clearly planned ahead of time (and not by her).  Both candidates claimed that the other one was trying to implement failed policies, but only one candidate made his point resonate.

Yep. 
Yep.  When you debate someone, you don't play by their rules.  Your opponent can ask you a question, but you're not required to answer their question.  You can use their question to point out their own hypocrisy, or you can use it as a springboard for something else, or you can dismiss it, or you can address it then minimize it.  He acted like he was trapped by her questions when he could've said something like "What you're saying isn't true, and this is why [brief explanation], but EVEN IF IT IS TRUE, you supported it!  You voted for it!"  That dismisses her entire attack and makes her look like a huge hypocrite.  He got so wound up that he missed that opportunity.  He lost sight of the big picture and was too worried about defending himself.  I'm sure his campaign manager is telling him all of these things right now and next time he'll be ready to turn things around.
Ah, the PoI reference, love it

He seriously might be the one to decide the presidency. If Trump does well next debate and Hillary doesn't, Wallace and his questions might have a massive influence. Big enough to decide some independents. 
I had a stop watch going. He'd call time on Trump right at the buzzer and let Hillary go on for 20-30 seconds before saying anything most of the time. When your answers are only 2min, an extra 30 seconds is a 25% increase.
Maybe next time he will go with "Failed presidential candidate Clinton"  Libtards were call him out for saying he is going to beat her.  And then Trump comes back with, no she failed against Obama.
She also called out Russia, the largest nuclear power in the world with 0 evidence. Yet trump is terrible on foreign policy lol

Evil Lizard Robots don't think
this is such banana republic cartoonish corruption I have to believe it's a planted story by the Clinton campaign.   &gt;Earlier last week an NBC intern was seen hand delivering a package to Clinton’s campaign headquarters, according to sources. **The package was not given to secretarial staff, as would normally happen, but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook.** Members of the Clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time, **and a reporter from Fox News recognized the intern, but said he was initially confused because the NBC intern was dressed like a Fed Ex employee.**  &gt;**The reporter from Fox questioned campaign staff about the intern, but campaign staff at first claimed ignorance and then claimed that it was just a Fed Ex employee who had already left.** No reporters present who had seen the intern dressed as a Fed Ex employee go into Mook’s office saw him leave by the same front entrance. **The Fox reporter who recognized the intern also immediately looked outside of the campaign headquarters and noted that there were no Fed Ex vehicles parked outside.**  Seriously this is a joke or something. 
Have you read How to Fail at Everything and Still Win Big? There's some good general advice in there I think
member berries?
Of course it is legal, Terry v. Ohio is a major landmark action for law enforcement. Most policing is done based on suspicion, if officers needed to wait for factual evidence to question no criminals would ever be investigated. That is why the FBI said murders are up 10% nationwide!!
Am I good that he uses existing tax loopholes and code to write off/deduct/pay as little taxes as possible regardless of income? Just goes to show you how broke the tax system really is.  On that yes I am good.  Simplify the system and remove the abused loop holes and deductions.  If what he is doing isn't illegal then more power to him.  If I could find a way to pay less taxes I would in a heartbeat.  
Its almost as if she is supporting Trump
The media doesn't care about the real issues, Trump is a name caller and a bully! Let's not discuss Hillary letting rapists walk and laughing about it. Instead let's focus on Trump calling Rosie a fat pig.

yeah i know a bunch of them from my facebook feeds (the SJWs and virtue signallers that attend my med school).  They kept making fun of Big Don throughout the debate.

Should be it's own post for this one, exactly how the debate went.
[removed]
Honestly, he did real good. He needed to show he was not un-hinged, unfit or radical. He did that. When it came to actual issues, he won bigly. This business about the first 45 and the last 45 is because the topics changed. Not sure how his taxes fit into the American prosperity but that's where the questions went.  If anything, he failed to do as a politician "answer the question you wish you were asked, not the question you're asked." He answered the questions Holt asked directly and allowed the media to run with their political candy. 
FAT FUCKING IDIOT  Nothing can absolve him from his previous crimes
a rape enabler and apologist.. great champion of women issues. 
The sound kept going up and down on both of them. The sound engineers...YOU'RE FIRED!
trump has literally given nothing but policy speeches for the last bunch of months, they are all on youtube and on his website in transcript form (although they are not archived well, you have to go look by dates i think)   a debate is not a place for detailed policy when you are getting cut off after 2 minutes and "fact checked" by some rogue moderator.  iran has been regularly antagonizing our ships including taking our sailors captive not too long ago, would you prefer to let them detain more of our soldiers.  also, you don't know that trump would blow anything out of the water.  the threat of doing so if the most effective deterrent to iran playing these games  hillary, on the other hand, has all but declared war on russia, and a vote for anyone but trump is half a vote for hillary clinton.
Presidential af. He also held back on Bill Clinton's infidelties because Hillary's daughter Chelsea was in the audience. True gentleman!
**BOOM, BITCH!**
i think once you've held the position of governor people typically address you as "Governor" forevermore.  see also "Secretary" Clinton...former SoS but etiquette is to use her former title.
Some big things overall that I noticed.  Like a salesman, he addresses concerns. Anything asked of him, he responds to. Hillary just ignores them, like when the press asks her a question and she just pretends to not hear.   I value the responses, but it means that whatever question is asked, it's going to make 5-10 minutes and be impactful, while Hillary just relies on people forgetting. Which is strong in cases where things need to move on to the next point-question.  It's of my opinion, that Trump underestimated Hillary and came in unprepared.  If you showed me this video, without a date stamp (and I forgot when pres debates happen) I would have thought this was over a year ago.  I think we got hustled. Just look at 2 ferns, which was a week ago. She looks like she's barely there. Last night, was like seeing someone awake from a coma.
This is amazing!
That's not in itself a lie, crime rates have been dropping.  They've been dropping because the federal government under Obama threatens to investigate any agency which arrests minorities at a greater percentage than they believe is necessary.  This leads to departments failing to file reports, failing to arrest, failing to investigate.  Combined with lack of public tax money for services (Detroit police will not respond to a whole list of crimes including, but not limited to, burglaries when someone isn't home, attempted carjackings, muggings, etc.), you get a situation where we're at the tipping point of crime not only going back up, but skyrocketing back up.  When people learn they can break the law without punishment, it means they're going to continue doing it and doing worse crimes.  I read a fantastic article about the federal government taking over agencies without any complaints, evidence, or otherwise.  I'll see if I can find it.

That 30 minute ass raping was just a teaser. He is capable of dismantling her at any point. Next debate it'll be an hour. Last debate, she'll have to be hauled out on a gurney
Trump won first half, draw the second. Considering Holt had loaded questions for Trump, fact checked him and interrupted Trump and gave Killary a pass it was a good show for Trump. 
Trump on this show would be freaking hilarious 
Yeah, just a mike. 
The most ignorant disgusting bigot to ever hold office crying racism again. You can't make that shit up. 
&gt;she didn't mean what she said she meant you're all racists  I don't like Hillary as much as the next guy but you're really stretching with that one
Not arguing with you here but can you send me a link that says he was a youth? I tried looking and couldn't find any, and I want to send that to someone
This is such a great way to say this. I've tried articulating something along these lines to close-minded liberals close to me but as soon as I mention Trump, they roll their eyes and shut their ears and then I resent them and give up. Well done. 
I visited CNN for the first time in months this morning to see what media bs they had about the debates. Its a complete shitshow. 
I think the electroshock treatment is actually how they bring her out of her naps (coma), she'd probably just laugh and poop her pants.
Literally thought she would pass out during her run on sentences.

Anyone who had any kind of interest in a discussion about policy was royally pissed at this debate.  It was seriously rehashing old and *concluded* things about Trump.  The birther thing is *over*.  Done.  He settled it.  Hillary's email scandal is *not*.  We're still finding things out, like StoneTear where Hillary's IT guy is literally asking Reddit how to obstruct justice a day after the Benghazi hearings when the emails were asked to be turned over.  Then, when he couldn't change the names, he outright deletes all of the files in direct violation of record keeping laws.  He even stated that, "they" wanted it.  Yet, this motherfucker gets an immunity deal with no strings attached - didn't even have to waive his 5th amendment right as part of that agreement so we could actually find out who was responsible.  We now know that FBI director Comey was a board member for HSBC bank, which did shady business dealings with the Clinton Foundation (along with drug cartels).  Comey's brother Peter does the Clinton Foundation's taxes.  Lynch, who is the only one responsible for pursuing charges, meets with Bill Clinton privately to discuss "golf" on his private plane before the FBI findings... then defers *her* choice on the matter to the corrupt FBI on whether to press charges.  This is top level corruption, and Hillary should be in prison over her complete disregard for safe record keeping practices and ignorance of classified information handling procedures.  She supposedly signed documents that states she knows how to handle classified material (which a judge has now asked for), and yet she gets to claim there was *no intent*?  This is bullshit of the highest order.  The fact we are even entertaining her leading the country after the FBI called her "extremely careless" is beyond me. 
Was thinking that every time she showed them.
Crooked CNN is tabloid trash that comes on TV.

It's a link to a twitter comment (one which wasn't mine anyway, I was just bringing attention to it) so I imagine most people who clicked on it commented there.
**"when they see Trump in a defensive posture, his supporters see Trump attacking.  His supporters see Trump defending in ways the Republican Party hasn't in a long time.  They see Trump standing up for them."**  This is so true. Rush nails it!

Nah, but that was the idea. It was something along the lines of "This year we have the first woman nominated for President, you said she doesn't 'look Presidential', she's standing here now, what did you mean by that?"
What do you have to say to those people who cast shadows on the white males legitimate problems with the current politically correct environment that nullifies our voice?
Liberal father doesn't like him, but says Hillary is fake as fuck. He is choosing to not vote at all.
Perfect choice. I hope this happens

It also makes sense when you look at how much she was blinking during the opening statements... She was concentrating on what she was hearing so she could recite it word for word...

Well considering I have done coke many times that is not how one would act after doing coke. Standing in front of 100million people on TV I would be paranoid as fuck and jittery and grabbing my dripping nose every other minute.   Any other coke users care to chime in? Just another lie from the government media complex. 
For me it's an odd respect that he's good at what he does, and he does it all out in the open, unlike Hillary.   Even when he wouldn't endorse, he did say "vote your conscience". Who in that room or watching that program wasn't going to think "Well, it's Trump or Hillary"  Is he snek? Yeah. But he's a solid snek.
Seriously.  I'm actually a registered democrat.  I can't stand the party as it stands at the moment, it's effectively cancer.   Just had a long discussion with a family member who is also democrat: but firmly entrenched in the "Trump is a nuclear warmonger" camp.   It's crazy how both sides think the other candidate is dumb as rocks.  Both of them are extremely smart and pretty clever.  I just think Trump is the better candidate by a vast margin compared to how corrupt Hillary is.
The president is a leader, so it would be good to look at a candidate's management of their staff (I guess to an extent, their family [children] and ex-lovers?). I think many people in Trump's camp respect him, first and foremost, like him and are very very competent, given the historic nature of his meteoric uprise. Hillary, on the other hand, has aides such as Abedin, Mills, and the many IT techs, who have shown themselves not only incompetent but corrupt, recently gaining immunity deals and/or pleading the fifth to the House Oversight Committee, despite their self-proclaimed innocence. Oh, and Bill is still dicking bimbos, according to Secretary of State Powell. She does not have her house in order.
Agreed. Great assessment! I was pacing around the room trying to call plays or his next responses to gut check her. It's good he didn't NBC he wanted to come across as softer and more approachable.   I have full faith that he's gonna crush debates 2 &amp; 3.  - I think he's gonna come back way stronger. Now that he's demonstrated his restraint.  - I think he's gonna memorize the plays better, how to dodge better, and counterpunch way better with his trademark one liners.  - He's gonna land statements better. Super predators came off as meek, it may have been the mic but that should have been a crushing sound bite. I hope he brings it back and does it with more conviction.  - He needs to break down the explanations about Clinton's corrupt fdn, pay to play, and how the server was created to evade telling the truth (see Stan Lee ABC clip) and how the government is protecting her with unprecedented FBI procedural breakdown.   We know the Clinton sex scandal. I think he can keep taking the high road. However someone said earlier such a great response to allude to it in a classier way.   - Trump: "Cyber security?!! Madam- putting you in charge of national cyber security would be as stupid as putting Bill Clinton in charge of monogamy."   *Stupid is as stupid does*. ;) - or to be tasteless, "...is like hiring Bill to be a bouncer at a strip club" or any other Wolf in the Hen house analogy.

I can't verify, so I deleted it
Bro she has mystery metal pieces falling out of her pants, and "ear pearls".  She wears incredibly expensive vision correcting glasses for people with strokes. She has double vision, and he eyes move independently due to nerve damage, she is perpetually dizzy and fucked up needing meds.  She probably has a brain implant for people with strokes too. When she does the head twitch it's probably going off, preventing an episode. When she sees bright lights her fucking eyes go crazy and with her double vision the balloons probably looked like a kaleidoscope.   Her waist area is always vague. She wears sack suits for a reason. To hide the anti-seizure device, or hide her colostomy bag.  She had her phones and ipads destroyed with hammers; we're way past normal. She's corrupt, criminal, and beyond government agency conviction.  She has a dude with daizepam injectors steps away 24 hours a day, and was physically carried unconscious to a car. Then the secret service didn't take her to a hospital, which is absurd; clearly she went to a private medical facility. They are not just going to let her be dragged to a car and then thrown on a couch to sleep it off. She was rushed someplace secret with an army of doctors, all so she can say she never went to the hospital. A nearly 70 year old woman with neurological problems who falls unconscious is going someplace with a fuckton of equipment and doctors.  THEN she had a little girl who is an on-tap Democrat distraction come to see her to distract the media, the same girl who asked the pope to give illegals amnesty. A child actor for all purposes.  She has an incredibly unfaithful husband she spends no time with at all, they are around each other  for only days per year. He's usually dicking bimbos on planes, or whatever he does, she could care less he's just another rung on the ladder to her goal of becoming president and shoving the entire country kicking and screaming into a cookie cutter to make us into a shape of her design.  She calls gun control "gun safety"  
Yup, probably more so.

&gt;but I disagree that you can lose a debate, but in that same debate, you won the election.    This line spoke to me. Couldn't agree more with your assessment. She needed a knockout blow and severely underestimated what it would take to knock Trump off his base. I do believe he likes to be underestimated and that team Clinton was really stupid enough to think she'd get rally Trump. 
Imgur is blocked at my workplace, sli.mg isn't.

That makes sense. And I'm not decrying the differences-vive la différence! You are right.  I think OP got that impression from articles like this one: http://archive.is/UvevX In fact that might explicitly be the reason he chose that word.  I read that "article" before the debate and with the help of Scott Adams I noted that such hyperbolic claims could only help Trump. He crushed it by being boring. I wish he was a little more thick skinned on the details of his reputation and history though. He'd do better with shorter answers IMHO.   "There was a problem with racism among developers in that era. The law suit hit thousands of developers and I am proud to say I was able to settle with "No Fault". I went on to build the first inclusive golf club in Palm Beach. The Trump organization is the good guy in this story. I hire for skill."  Bonus Ending: "If I discover that my staff are doing business based on race, I will fire them. I fire racists."  
&gt;&gt; he got in some good counterpunches &gt; &gt;TRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.  #BTFO
etc etc etc. seriously so many questions not asked
Are y'all all retarded? Getting asked more questions in the debate is a good thing. You use them to make yourself look better. You don't go to a debate hoping you don't get asked questions lmao.
She is so creepy fake. when ever she does something "human" like that she keeps doing it to milk audience reaction. It's a sign of a deep dissociative issue. I read it as in part that she   1) wiggles to seem human/funny.   2) the audience laughs   3) Hillary thinks; "oh the like this! Oh they like me! Oh, I can let them know we are all in on the joke together and this is a fake gesture anyways so I will smile inclusively and keep doing it."  4) Weird smile and strangely extended behavior  I know that's going a bit deep but I think that's what is going on and why it's so super weird.  
Done, thanks!

He would have hammered it home if he'd just considered what the main talking points were likely to be and had ammunition ready to show why Clinton has fucked it up in the past.  Then just stick to his usual script of "we're going to fix this by putting our best people on it because we're the best" and he'd have taken last night easily.   I don't know why he didn't hit Clinton harder.  The whole "I'll release my tax docs when you release your E-mails" was only a taste of the fire he should have spewed for the entire debate.  Perhaps he's saving it for the last 2 debates.  Maybe his plan is to come in strong for the last one in particular that he just makes her look like a fool.  Maybe he didn't want to let loose too much last night so that it doesn't seem like he's repeating himself in the next 2 debates.
Yeah, Hillary came off as super condescending/sarcastic while Trump is amped up and passionate about the real issues. If you had to choose one person who you thought would actually get anything done it would be Trump. Hillary was just acting like a bitch.

Intellectual idiots are real
Here is the evidence:  -Blumenthal work on Hillary campaign for a short time  -Left campaign early but was still very close advisor to Hillary  -Hillary and Obama had very dirty battle for nomination   -Blocked by Obama for starting negative stories during primaries  -Blumenthal admitted starting stories  -Multiple places say they got the pictures from the Hillary campaign  Unless you want a recording of Hillary actually saying she started it then this is together is a lot of evidence that her campaign was involved.

It's also literal cuckoldry.  Average cost of childcare per year is around $5k. My wife and I paid around $20k in tax last year.  We're burdened with supporting 4 children that aren't even ours before we can begin to have kids of our own.  Think about that.
The key words in that is "agreed to consider." If you think MSM is going to take any questions that are anti-Hillary no matter how many votes, you haven't been watching this election.
Or if you want to have their sideways view of the world,  the term is "control-alt-left".

I agree. And enthusiasm counts for a lot in elections.  So the idea that just because they're online polls, they're not measuring anything signficant, is I think mistaken.  If it were merely a matter of whose astroturfers got to which polls faster, then you'd likely see her winning the larger ones and him winning the smaller ones.  Instead he won them all, big and small, except one or two.  That is an indicator.

&gt; Bushes &amp; Clinton's are like kissin cousins when it comes to MIC, Drugs &amp; Oil profiteering.  Bush endorsed Clinton.  They are both Leftists.  The Republican party is fine once we kick out these fuckers that infiltrated it.  They are all desperate and we know who they are because they are against Trump.  By the way there is no 'oil profiteering'.  We gained nothing from our Middle Eastern wars.  They were all started by the Leftists for the end game we are in:  the Muslim refugee crisis.  They want their votes to seal the EU.  WWIII won without a fight.

I earned a scholarship to go to law school while I worked as an EMT throughout most of college. I go to a tier 1 law school, where most of my class mates pay full tuition, and came straight from undergrad, never having held a real job.

I think there was room for improvement, but I think Trump ultimately succeeded in what the goal for that night was, which was to appear human and likable. Clinton had accused him, his family, and all his supporters of every -ism and -phobia there is, and painted a picture of a belligerent, aggressive, and insulting man. Trump instead was courteous to Clinton and treated her with respect, whereas she was the one insulting him, completely contradictory the narrative, and that's pretty important when you have many viewers watching who have previously only heared of Trump as if he were the devil incarnate. Then you have moderator being completely biased in favor of Clinton, which plays into the majority of Americans distrust of the media. When 68% of Americans already distrust the media, having the media and the media-sponsored moderator appear to be your ally is completely detrimental.
That shouldn't even be a question. Pvt. companies should be allowed to hire whoever they want, even if it is discriminatory.

Aka "regressives"
You hit the nail on the head.  I got a B.S. in microbiology and currently make about 45k/year in the sf bay area at a research position in a small biotech. I work ridiculous overtime in an exempt position, so the quoted hourly rate of ~$23/hour is much lower.  My brother started his apprenticeship as a carpenter about a year ago and makes $31/hr + ot.  We constantly joke I should quit and become an electrician (our father is a self employed general contractor, so I have an understanding for the work having spent my summers helping out).    Granted there's slightly more to this than simply the wage. He takes a massive toll on his body. If I cared only about the money I would be seeking better employment much more actively, instead I care about the research we're doing which could be a massive revolution for drug discovery and I'm gambling with company stock options for the next few years, once I hit 28/9 I'll be much more worried about a better salary over stock options. But for simply making a living, going straight into the trades or any real world experience is usually a better option and it is a shame that it's being phased out of k-12 as being a valid option (with most schools getting rid of shop classes and such). 
Don't let the frogophobes win!
It sounds high energy from a mile away! 
Its possible they may have had one of those butane extract things set up incorrectly and it blew up ?
I mean I guess it's SOMETHING... 
ADL split from the based Jewish community a while ago. Remember when they declared Trump's  sheriff's star an anti-Semitic symbol, then it was also found on a box of Disbey Frozen stickers, implicating Elsa as a neo-Nazi. ADL needs to disband. They are a joke. 
I didn't realize, they were BadAss when they took out those terrorists on live t.v.! I have to keep up with the politics more.
'knowingly golfing'?
Great News! 
Zach Galifianakis did scripted production for Hillary, and the deal was with DEMs that Trump would not get this millenial attention grabbing action.

People like to think Trump is just some real estate developer. He has a degree in economics from the best business school in the world.
That'd be wasting it if he snorted it.
&gt;“I wish I wouldn’t have done,” Muir said. “It was stupid. I feel ashamed that I did it.”  That's a real theme with the Democrats and their lovely candidate, isn't it?  They're perfectly content to lie, steal, cheat, rig, and generally use dishonest methods to get whatever petty satisfaction they want, *right up to* the moment that they're caught.  THEN all of a sudden it's a tragedy, they're ashamed, they would have done it all differently, it was a momentary thing.  It's not like was an isolated incident: I don't know about you guys, but I've honestly wanted to rip up a yard full of Shillary signs that has sprouted up a few doors down from me, but I don't, because I'm a fucking adult.  This is a Ph.D level college admin, supposedly one with the laurel that denote some of the highest minds in America, that not once, not twice, not thrice, but a total of 7 TIMES walked onto someone's property, defaced their stuff, then just walked off with it.  I can honestly say that if I did the same thing *once*, I would feel guilty enough about it to not walk by that person's house for at least a week after the fact, mostly because my parents taught me the right and wrong ways to deal with things.  You don't regret it at all, you absolute cretin.  You regret that you were dumb enough to get caught, dumb enough to not notice a sign specifically stating that there was a camera trained on you the entire time.  You didn't suddenly develop a conscience because the police came knocking, you just realized that you needed to try and weasel your way out of this so you tried to say what you thought they wanted to hear.  You would have probably continued to do this same thing up until election day had you not been caught ~~red~~ blue-handed. Reminds me of your candidate a great deal, and that's about the worst insult I can think of.  
Don't know what's higher at this point: The Energy, or The Wall.
She also wants to take away 65% of any business owner's estate from families when they pass. So anyone trying to rise above being a simple employee is fucked.
Damn the Trump Force One is beautiful 
Guess it is never too late. Question is...where and who? Is there anyone/network who would be considered unbiased enough for both sides?
No.  [TFW no qt3.14 Trumpfriend to Make Australia Great Again](http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/images/1310497604344.jpg) 
without the mainstream media she wouldn't even be here - Donald Trump
Another great point. They literally dont know the difference between a business entity and a w-2 employee

The Trump Family Fold here is quite accepting. Makes one wonder if maybe it isn't time to make some new friends. Ones with thicker skin and more tolerance towards their fellow human race.  {{{ HUGS }}}
All talk No action! (we need a bot)
Here now apparently 12k+ outside can't get in, I believe it, it took me almost 30 minutes just to park
I'm not sure about it. Our government is in major debt and runs a massive deficit. Keeping all your tax dollars is about the same effect as every American talking out a loan thousands of dollars at whatever rate the national debt accrues. It's far from fiscally responsible.   Now the black hat side of me knows our debt-based economy is doomed to fail eventually. Heaping more debt on the pile will only hasten the inevitable. The notion that stopping tax collection will revive our economy to levels that more than offset the debt, while we're still making massive payments in welfare, for a military empire,  and in foreign aid, I just don't see it.
Or every other day in June, July and August because there simply isn't enough time to learn about microaggressions from your gender studies prof's book tour AND file an abuse report about a new form of hate speech.
Last night was about taking all the Left's talking points away.  Tonight is about the ISSUES
It's hilarious that Obama got so pissed off about this though. What did he have to hide?
Remember when The witch said that he just has a message of fear and panic....him talking about terrorism is true, and it's becoming all too common, so common that msm doesn't feel the need to report on the Bombings a few days ago in NJ and NY. Fucking incompetent Hiliary 
1%er here. The rich don't have tax problems. They have the lawyers and the time and money to structure everything so they pay as little as legally possible, and it's a pain in the ass.   Paying 15% with no hassle is preferable to paying 2% while juggling accountants and what not. 
It makes sense now why Amazon.com was wiping the negative reviews--they knew she was going to direct people to buy her book, and where else than amazon when on the couch? Can't have people finding out about her scandals and how much people really truly despise her. 
RSBN, your sound feed is TOPS tonight!!!!!!!

$16 million in 28 hours = $571,429 per hour... MAGA..
It's taken almost a full day to get another shot of this letter. I'm not keeping my hopes up.  Keep hitting deport, fellow centipedes!
What do you think happens when we cannot pay the police, firefighters, welfare checks, and any and all of the social services of this country because we are stuck paying on the interest of 20trillion freaking dollars. That is a huge amount. It completely collapses. Just like in a business, keep spending more than you make you go out of business.

&gt; When you have to run a factory with time sensitive processes and you don't have a reliable or affordable electrical grid or water supply or transportation capabilities  A fair civil/regulatory court system and decent infrastructure used to be the last two pros of operating in the US. Workers cost alot, and taxes suck. BUT you can get shit done, and if something goes wrong you can be compensated eventually.  Both of those are disappearing rapidly. US will be unable to compete as it's prime infrastructure decays past the developing nations. Transnational freight lines. Massive bridges. Enormous dams. These were all built over a century ago.  My current city doesn't even want to expand roadways that were designed for traffic flow estimates **FROM 40 YEARS AGO.**
Why make your own America when you can distort it?

What do you think is happened? The establishment is terrified that you'll wake up and think for yourself and decide enough is enough and upend the establishment. 
##**Buy order placed!**  The price of [PEPE](https://sli.mg/ufBMzs) just went up^up^up! $10693 is the current price.  One share added to rsashe1980's portfolio. They now own 19 shares.    -bot by GIGWT /u/GuessIllGoWithThis
Trump voters can and should let their state and local candidates know how they feel. Maybe a push from constituents will help in some cases.
wait..
Almost. I laugh everytime I see it and give it an upvote. KKKlinton! 
*However, because so many Pepe the Frog memes are not bigoted in nature, it is  important to examine use of the meme only in context.  The mere fact of posting a Pepe meme does not mean that someone is racist or white supremacist.  However, if the meme itself is racist or anti-Semitic in nature, or if it appears in a context containing bigoted or offensive language or symbols, then it may have been used for hateful purposes.*  So the only ones which are bigoted/racist are the one that contain bigoted/racist imagery, isn't that the case for everything?
Amen.  Proud deplorable here either way.
Well I guess now that I am officially a hateful racist, there is no harm in going further with it. Thats what the ADL is telling me.  Any jewish people want to correct my thought process here? Pretend I'm 10 years old.
I laughed at 2 of those racist pepes..  Because i'd never seen em before and didn't know pepe was racist ever lol 
it also stands for Veterans Affairs within government, trump sometimes talks about that

Time to sue, they clearly just copied and saved the image. **DONT THEY KNOW THAT DO NOT COPY IS NOT A JOKE?!?!**
"Not all Pepe's are racist, in fact, most are not. But if a Pepe is racist, it is a hate symbol. Therefore, Pepe is a hate symbol."

What does that guy take off the podium when they walk toward the moderator?!
Fucking amazing and sad what a mess this country is in. What the fuck happened to freedom of speech????
thank you! I was considering writing a "how to convince other liberal feminists to vote trump" type of post. The most surprising and delightful part of being a centipede was seeing how many different viewpoints were "acceptable." I see Christian and atheists, pro life and pro choice, etc, speaking cordially and working together on the issues that all of us have in common.  In the liberal community, I risk being called "problematic" (fuck that word) even if I'm speaking out to agree on a liberal agenda issue because I don't agree with "health at every size" or some other unrelated issue. When you're liberal, you're indoctrinated to think there's One True Way to be and think, and if you deviate you're labeled a problem and an outsider. If someone agrees with 90% of your views, you're supposed to attack them on the other 10%- and you can't let it stand that there are just different folks, and a multitude of perspectives that combine to form a community. I don't agree with every fucking opinion of every fucking white male (heh) here but I can recognize our shared goals and defend their rights while disagreeing with aspects of their philosophy.

Exactly people seem to forget that the reason that she had to testify for 11 hours was a direct result of her failure as Secretary of State. And I'm sorry but sitting in a chair answering questions for 11 hours is really not that physically Taxing.

Hillary is 69, isn't she? Her father would've been born in the early 1900s. Not defending her bullshit, but handmade shit like that would have been a lot more common back then. Before we started importing it all from China. 
IT'S ALIVE!!! ...almost
the nose knows
CNN and Hillary supporters despise work ethic
They all think it's over after last night. I don't think she will see the gains they are thinking. She did better than I thought partially bc I didn't know if she would have any energy. This is going to be interesting to watch. 
I was watching CSPAN and Trump pats her on the back and then moves his hand and the. Pats her suspiciously in a different spot. It was just below H's left shoulder blade.

Even the "peaceful" protests resulted in them blocking roads and highways.  If I was stuck behind a load of people who had turned a city upside down on monday and tuesday, burnt cars and trucks down...yeah, most people are going to be quite nervous and fearful.  I'd be the fuck out of there after watching people get stripped nude, dragged and beaten like it's fuckin Mogadishu.  These people are terrorists.  Planting packages and calling in bomb threats. Killing EACH OTHER during riots.  Destroying local businesses.  Dude if a bomb went off and blew up a street, they'd call it terrorism.  But, hey...when it's thousands of people destroying many streets and businesses, successfully turning a fair amount of Charlotte into a no-go-zone...somehow, it's not terrorism.    Politics, pandering, and racial violence that goes unquestioned.  
He's probably using a tax haven... that's how you play the game right now. It's too expensive to keep your money in the USA 
Under the map there are five polls listed for 9/26. The middle one is New York at Clinton +2.3.  Back on the 23rd, she was at 21%
This in combination with that one random guy taking papers...there needs to be an investigation. Surely this is breaking the rules lol
Did u see the protester? He was near the front toward the right of the stage. Morbidly obese guy in wheelchair stood up and ripped off his shirt and revealed a black lives matter shirt.  Then he just stood there and faced off with people. We shoved Trump signs in his face 
U Bing bro?

Well those sure are cherry picked as fuck to fit their narrative.  Even just image searching "pepe the frog" right now brings up a bunch of goofy random ones - nothing racist or anything.
its understandable considering he worked hard to get in office and people were trying to completely discredit him through flimsy at best evidence. Id be pissed too.

Congratulations.  See, I may not want to bake a cake for your wedding, but I'm never going to deny your right to speak your mind, or view you as somehow less than human because of who you are or who you want to vote for.  Don't let other people intimidate you into silence.
I'm not gonna take this too seriously.  I'm a huge fan of his, in fact I think he's the funniest person alive.  He's not one of these John Oliver types who preaches and disguises it as comedy.  His standup is hilarious, he says a lot of politically incorrect stuff, and makes fun of everyone, kinda like South Park.

&gt; As a Minnesotan, I would love to see Trump take our state and the election in general. Unfortunately, as we seem to flip-flop parties for Senators and the Governor, our Presidential voting history has been consistently Blue.   Yeah, but another "looting riot" or even a second "stabby-stab-stab-stab" attack at a shopping mall (to say nothing of some impromptu "kaboom" ~~bombing~~ *explosive* event) will probably make the entire state start bleeding deep RED.
Dicks out for this guy's slice of pizza?

I was one of them. I was definitely won over though.
Yup, though I'm not 150% on the train like some people on here. I can use my brain and see that Hillary is corrupt as fuck. Trump is far from perfect as well, but it's honestly so sad being a conservative swing voter in CA.   Tried talking to my Mother about the debate and my view on the two candidates, said I don't like either but prefer Trump. Attempted to tell her my reasoning, she ignores whatever I say and retorts with "I'm disappointed with your intelligence". My own Mother.  Of course her reasons behind not liking Trump were completely sensationalist and emotional; Because she thinks he's a "disgusting person" (meaning he says rude things sometimes).  Also in class today I got to hear a bunch of classmates talk about how much of an ugly idiot Trump is and how much of a beautiful, intelligent and all knowing godsend of a person Hillary is. It's a wasteland out here, I won't even bother voting. I'd rather not get harassed for having a different opinion.

Our society is regressing. 8 years with a progressive president and our society is regressing... And their solution will be to double down. You see what happens here is that people have become so inept that they are blind to the fact that this leadership (or lack there of) has gotten us to this point. You hear it from everyone "things have never felt worse. We are so divided" yet they look to status quo and a political dynasty as the solution. 24 years of Clinton/bush and they are clamoring for more. Who got us here everyone?

THIS!!! This is a nationalism issue cut and fucking dry. 
On April 19th, 2016, an anonymous user posted a lengthy rant in a discussion thread about the United States presidential primaries on 4chan’s /pol/ (politically incorrect) board[13]:      Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I’m so distressed right now I don’t know what to do. I didn’t mean to do that to my mom but I’m literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he losing? This can’t be happening. I’m having a fucking breakdown. I don’t want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Bernie to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well in New York???? This is so fucked.

What happens if you replace "alt right" with "liberal social justice warriors"? Answer: The headline becomes a fact.

[deleted]
Nice title. I know you're very likely a recovering liberal from that title.  The drug war was never properly fought. Trump talks all the time about the drug problem. The thing is, if he builds his wall and begins to treat the cartels as terrorist threats and begins to take them out, then the drug war is won.  Follow the money. It really tells you something about the world when we care about some shithole desert halfway across the world rather than actual Mexican terrorists on our southern border.
The US flag is already banned from several high schools, because it makes the hispanic students feel bad. Furthermore, I forget which college, exactly, but someone at a college made a barbecue with America as the theme, whose purpose was to help the clubs and student organizations around the college get some advertisement out there.  Days before the event, the college demanded that they remove the America from the BBQ.  America is literally becoming verboten in America.

That whole thing just thought for dumb people. This is how you feel. Yes. Now direct your attention here.   Fucking 1984 
This is what we are all waiting to see happen on live TV, but our prophetic Dilbert-merchant tells us that if Trump stays ahead in the polls he won't do anything differently.   Trump has left himself every option right now. He could keep it the same, be boring, not scary and stay ahead in the polls and win the election. He could gradually ramp up the pressure so there is a clear trend (It's harder to pretend an upward trend doesn't exist than it is to spin a single debate). He could listen to the MSM pundits and study some memorized zingers. Probably other options I can't even think of. 
If 20 years ago is irrelevant then how is bringing up shit Trump's father dealt with in 1973?
I don't think he's a traitor as much as he just doesn't pay very close attention to the_donald and just agreed on a whim to shill for nimbleamerica without checking what it was about at all.   Milio just isn't involved enough in the_donald to be a part of it tbh.

&gt;Soy contains phytoestrogens called isoflavones that may mimic the activity of the hormone estrogen in your body.  For an example of an extreme case, look at before/after pics of people who use Soylent. Its a soy-based drink that totally replaces all your meals, and it feminizes the everliving shit out of people.  &gt;BPA is a weak synthetic estrogen found in many rigid plastic products, food and formula can linings, dental sealants, and on the shiny side of paper cashier receipts (to stabilize the ink). Its estrogen-like activity makes it a hormone disruptor, like many other chemicals in plastics.  Odds are decent that more plastic compounds beyond BPA also mimic estrogen, but the studies are probably either being suppressed or poorly funded. Plastics are a huge business and they have enough money to control the narrative surrounding them.  There *is* a fair amount of information on this out there, though. BPA is just the most famous because the libs/hipsters threw a fit about it a few years ago.  &gt;Some shampoos popular with African Americans contain high enough doses of estrogen to push young girls into early puberty.  &gt;Unbeknown to many parents, a few hair products - especially some marketed to black people - contain small amounts of hormones that could cause premature sexual development in girls...  &gt;Throughout the West, girls are tending to reach puberty earlier. This has been blamed on everything from improved diet to environmental contaminants. But African-American girls are developing even earlier than their white counterparts. About half of black girls in the US begin developing breasts or pubic hair by age eight, compared with just 15 per cent of white girls, one study has found. In Africa, girls enter puberty much later, regardless of their socioeconomic status.  Also:  &gt;**What environmental estrogens are likely to be present in cosmetics?**  &gt;These include names like:  &gt;Parabens – These are used extensively as a preservative in low amounts (0.1-0.3% by weight per ingredient). Types include butylparaben, ethylparaben, isobutylparaben, methylparaben, propylparaben.  &gt;Placental Extracts – these contain hormones estrogen, estrone, and progesterone as contaminants. They are found in shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers and astringents, body and skin creams.  &gt;UV Screens – these are UV protection creams and photo-stabilizers. They are used in high amounts of 2-15% by weight per ingredient. Many commonly used UV-screens are absorbed by the skin and get access to the blood stream. They are found in sunscreens, perfumes, hair sprays, shampoos, conditioners, styling gels, facial creams, foundations, moisturizers, lipsticks, liquid hand soaps, body wash, insect repellants, nail polish and polish remover, and aftershave and shaving creams. The harmful chemicals in UV screens are benzophenone-1, benzophenone-2, homosalate, octinoxate, oxybenzone, sulisobenzone, and 4-MBC (this is used in Europe but not in the United States).  The results above are from quick, mildly drunken internet searches I did just now and are in no way comprehensive. Bing some keywords to find out more.   Its honestly horrifying how many everyday items/compounds there are that have estrogenic effects on the human body.

#THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO *MANAGE* MONEY...  #THEY'RE TRYING TO *LAUNDER IT!!!*
Ya I looked into it more. You have to go back 2 full week to figure out what is going on. I initially I thought it was just a bad day falling off. However... I believer the 19-20 fell off today, a .8 drop for trump. But you also have to look at what caused the .8% drop for Trump. Well go back 1 more week.... It was the polling done on the 12th. Probably Hilary's worst day maybe ever. So it may be that the polling really was not that bad on the 19th or 20th, it is just that it was VERY bad on the 12th and 13th. So then I look further back. She was having a steady climb in this poll until the 11th. So that means solid to good numbers for her had to filter out before the full effect of the the terrible numbers for the 12th and 13th. Trump peaked on the 18th. EXACTLY 1 week after the collapse. All her good prior 9/11 numbers fell out and the really bad days showed her full effect.  So my conclusion is that the bad day for Trump on the 18-20th was not due to an event, but rather the numbers from the hysteria on the 11th and 12th fell out and he was returning to mean. Good news was the new mean was still higher than it was prior to the mega bounce, so net gain. I think considering all of this today might actually show solid numbers for trump, it was not bad numbers on the 20th, it was that the numbers on the 20th were .8 worse than the terrible numbers Hilary had right after the collapse.   I have Concluded that he had a very had day on the 15-16th. Which was birther day and the day after. You saw a small dip on the 16th but the numbers slightly recovered until the 20th when Clinton's worst day's began to fall off. The 18-22 drop was a combination of the hysteria wearing off from the collapse and trumps 1 bad day. Notice Trump's numbers started to rebound once the 16th fell off. The polling on the 16th must have been pretty bad to cause a dent in the hilary collapse numbers. Meaning Polling could very well be equal or higher than it was on the 20th (which fell of today). So my prediction is in this poll we will be flatish with your normal ups and downs.
I'm not sure, but they are explicitly in favor of Hillary. Politico is probably consolidated by one of the big MSM groups.

Wow
I don't know, I've looked into it in the past and Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn pretty much decide the entire state since they voted 80 - 90% Obama in 2012. The rest of the state is within 40 - 60% red or blue. With Trump being pretty popular in the NYC area and his whole New York values speech in the primaries, plus all the former Bernie supporters in those few counties I mentioned earlier which decide the entire state, not to mention the Bernie supporters in the rest of the state, a large portion of which will vote third party to send a message because NY is always though of a as a safe dem stronghold, New York could very well be in play. I would say it's unlikely, but it's probably possible.

My thoughts/observations...  - The debate was possibly the first time many undecideds saw him live. Everything they have seen before was the MSM making him out as a crazy dangerous villain. From that viewpoint the Trump they saw would have been very different. I think I'm starting to fully understand his strategy and [what Scott Adams said about it.](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/151007796236/i-score-the-first-debate)  - It looks like he is building a floor of support with African American voters.  - Intention to vote is skyrocketing for Trump!  edit: more detailed info -&gt; http://cesrusc.org/election/
Ah yes, the Farrage and Hannipede. Dream team.

Shoo
That coughing is so annoying..
I think it was glare from the ceiling lights. Look at Trumps hair...or the shine on the back of his head. It powers down at the same time. I think she is shady as they come...I just don't think the podium powered down. 
Hey, this is Barron!
As Colin Powell said in his emails,"Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris,”.  
Kudos for consistency. I'd like Trump to change his stance on climate change though. 
Well I didn't want to just broadcast it out, but I've got a hot tip, there's going to be some heavy trading today. Insider-training, it's not technically illegal, I promise. It's just ocurring inside of this train, that's not fucking illegal. You know what, no, I'm going to just tell you in person. 
Gotta get that pregame going. I don't know about you, but my ass has been tingling for this all week.

Aaaaaand just getting started!

At the debate I believe - something like: you weren't against it until after it passed
I count Rockford as part of Chicago.  ;)  Rockford  kind of is near Beloit.  It seemed as soon as winter hit they has snow on the ground the entire season.  How are winters in Rockford?
What they mean is whoever is associated with this symbol should be hated. 
It's defiantly deeper than Obama. This has been going deeper than GWB sr. was in power and Obama is just part of the crew than wants Hilary on the team. Depending on what sources you trust, this goes down all the way to the NWO. Call me a conspiracy theorist if you want-- the world is over populated, pure resources are being depleted and the NWO needs the population down to 100,000,000 to start anew. Why do you think all this death and rioting is going down to separate our country while the government is brining in 100k-200k immigrants who believe in Sharia Law? Why do you think there is GMOs in our food to slowly poison us and make us idiotic? No Alex Jones, not the lizard people. On accident? Hell no.

If polls were rigged, Donald would have won by a billion votes.
Dammit I linked the ad.
Gowdy should have his own late night program where he subpoenas different corrupted pieces of shit in our gov't and gets to grill them for a full uninterrupted hour. Hillary Clinton goes first.   Edit: So apparently Comey can't push through the easiest perjury case ever about Clinton and her email. Yeah my ass Comey.   Edit 2: Clinton had the greatest lawyer in Comey in her pocket the whole fucking time. He literally has a bullshit cop to everyone of the questions from the chair.   Edit 3: This crypt keeper mother fucker really trying to push a Trump/Russian connection? Like are you fucking retarded? Also I like how Trump isn't even President yet and he makes sure to bring people with Security Clearances to his classified briefings.   Edit 4: Yo this Snausagebreaker guy or whatever his name is fucking legit. You get em Snausagebreaker!  Edit 5: Mr. Nadler is going out of his way to say so many words that have a P in them.   Edit 6: Here's a bunch of evidence that shows you should reopen the case Mr. Comey will you do that? "Nah"  Edit 7: If the Russians hacked into Democratic Parties fucking everything why are you stupid Democrats going after Trump? Why don't you focus on working on strengthening your own shit? Trumps gonna win and the Democrats are going scream the Russians hacked our shit and determined the outcome LMAO! How fucking pathetic.   Edit 8: I love how Comey refuses to say she was lying.   Edit 9: "They would be in big trouble if they did this" SO WHY THE FUCK DOES SHE HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES?!?!?  Edit 10: The more and more that Comey says the FBI was unbiased with this investigation and there was no bullshit of any kind with it makes me only think that something is up with investigation and that it was fucked up.   Edit 11: What are going to do about him destroying evidence? "No Comment"  Edit 12: FUCK HIM UP MR. ISSA!

We love our BEAUTIFUL BLONDES at this hearing!
Voter fraud is only a concern if you're incapable of winning. The dems whined about hanging chads twenty years ago. But now that they have more sophisticated means, by way of the winner of that contest, the Bush family. The way they see it, cheating is ok because they can't win in a fair contest. It's why they shut down Bernie. It's why they'll attempt to shut down Trump.
whichever makes her look less guilty. which is some combination of both.
Comey better have an investigation open right now on the Clinton foundation. 
She was also a lawyer at 27.   Gee i wonder who paid for her law school... was it her "poor drapery factory" father?   Probably.    It's almost like someone else enabled her to do better in life.    But that's crazy, parents never do that for their kids.
maoware. . .
Everyone but Hilary
The Democratic party isn't bring their best folks. They're bringing their idiots, they're bringing their deflectors, and most, I assume, are fucking imbeciles.
anyone have a stream with a live chat?

Lol I know. Chabot's a good dude, and he brings up good points, but I much prefer Jordan, Chaffetz, and Gowdy to be the ones going after Comey.
It's amazing she doesn't understand exactly what she's saying. So what she is wanting is for women who do less of a job than men, to get paid the same.

Uhhh, being extremely fucking careless with classified information - smashing the phones with hammers once you get under investigation and then covering it up and deleting your emails and you wouldn't be prosecuted? What the fucking fuck

Considering that Comey stated he knew the emails were going to come up...does anyone else think he is woefully unaware of the the details/facts that would seem like preparation for appearing before a judiciary committee?

When Chaffetz comes on its all over, he's gonna open him up
Exactly. Especially with cleaning up his delivery. If he does that, there are so many examples that he can hit Hillary with.   I really think he ought to use what Reagan did against Carter (and what Eminem did in 8 mile). By early in the debate say something along the lines of, "Hillary Clinton only has the ability to make baseless attacks against me, because her record of 30 years has shown nothing but failures." So later in the debate, when she makes another baseless personal attack, he can just reply with, "There you go again."

They left the fruit on the trees to rot because the fruit was literally rotten.  You had canker and citrus greening that hit Indian River County very hard.  It absolutely does not cost more to pick it than it would cost to get in the market.  That's a ridiculous statement.  Florida's main orange is the Valencia orange.  Most of the oranges in Florida go into making orange juice (90% in fact).  Mexico's main export is the Navel orange which costs more than the Valencia orange to grow and process as it's eaten whole and appearance becomes an issue.  Given that Mexico exports a very small percentage of their oranges produced and the oranges are not for the same purpose, your comments make absolutely no sense.

GREAT LINE OF QUESTIONING BY JORDAN.  Now that we know Combetta's immunity agreement is limited, I believe Comey's evasion and ignorance re: FBI's knowledge of Combetta's Reddit post is intentional.  If Comey admits that FBI was unaware of Combetta's Reddit post, THEY WILL HAVE TO reopen investigation.  Comey is trapped...
Guaranteed cuck. Just by looking at him. 
No, I don't think so.
Literally all his speeches right now are broadcast to tens of thousands. He fears nothing. What's she hiding?
#DOUBLE STANDARDS  Trying to Logan Act Trump when CLINTON IS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE! Fucking backwards!
reads his tweets, aaaand he's a hill shill 
And Clinton knows she can get away with this stuff because her and the MSM already came up with the though-terminating-cliche of the "vast righ-wing conspiracy," so now whenever they *do* engage in a conspiracy, they can say it's just a witch-hunt.  It allows them to get away with *even more* conspiracies.
#OMG IS HILLARY BEING INVESTIGATED? QUICK DISTRACT WITH HOW SOME GUY HAS SOME MINOR LINK TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY COMMUNIST RUSSIA HERP DERP

Who is this Mr. Doosh guy?
What the motherfucking shit fuck cock balls does any of this have to do with Trump? Demotards are reaching far. 
This guy is trying to use a joke by Donald to act as if he 'asks Russia to hack the US' (Hillary does the same).  It just goes to show how desperate they are.

I'm sure he received instruction from Obama and the DOJ.  Not defending Comey, but we need to go to the root of the problem. Even if Gowdy or Chaffetz themselves were the FBI Director they would have been limited by Obama and Lorreta Lynch.  President Obama and DOJ Lorreta Lynch need to be impeached first, we can deal with Comey later.  If you impeach Comey, it will feel good, but Obama get to put another "lacky" in his place.
Unbelievable. Comey was saved by the clock for follow up questions.
I still want to know why that kid punched him in the face and why the other guy didn't punch him back
They're not even hiding their bias!

Interestingly, my MIL turned from her during the debate because of her body language and canned answers.  Her text to me halfway through the debate was:   &gt;"I can't vote for Hillary anymore.

I for one thing that they are missing the big ones. The word wall should definately be a hate word, used for prosecution in hate hate speech and hate crimes. Along with the Confederate flag, and even the American flag. The chant "USA, USA" is definitely hate speech. As is "Make America Great Again". Obviously using the word Mexico or Mexican when referring to someone from that country is totally racist as well. (Not Canada or Canadian, obviously). And while we're at it, ill and sick should be there too. Oh, and the biggest one is definately trump. As a noun and a verb, along with huge when pronounced like a new yorker. And the word unbelievable.   Also, not saying things should be a criminal offense. You must say things all day like, "Whites are racist, men are misogynists, Islam is the religion of peace."   Plus, not voting for Hillary is a hate crime.

It's such a tough thing to talk about for a Republican. You have the Republican base watching, after all, and you can't appear to be soft on crime.

Fits with my post from last night:  "Showerthought: A great thing about last night's debate was that many Americans listened to Mr. Trump talk for the first time without MSM shills editing out the parts they didn't like."  https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/54uk0a/showerthought_a_great_thing_about_last_nights/  Personally, I thought the debate was a stalemate. I also think Trump was purposefully holding back. Still, Trump wins in the sense that a lot more people got to see him talk.

http://pagesix.com/2016/09/17/different-earpiece-guidelines-after-lauers-pathetic-trump-and-clinton-interviews/  The Commission on Presidential Debates will allow moderators to wear earpieces if they choose, but the executive producer of the commission will be the only person in their ear. Executive producers from the news organizations will not have editorial control and the earpieces are mainly to keep track of timing.
A). Comey must resign B) Trump must be elected to clean house of corruption at all levels starting with Lynch C)  these immunity deals all stink to high heaven.   There was a cover up D) Gowdy and Chaffetz are great.  Darrel Issa came through.  Some chick wearing a Hillary pin on the committee is completely cucked with Lynch and Cheryl Mills. E) Asa sidebar, they can't vet any of these Syrians coming in.  But if you know they've done something bad once there here...they'll look into it. F). We are fucked when our justice dept has become a political operative.
There is incontrovertible proof the Clinton deleted thousands of records, the loss of which may well be to conceal other crimes, while under congressional subpoena.    There is incontrovertible proof her IT guru was looking to corrupt records by changing names in the email archives.      There is incontrovertible proof she housed thousands of secret documents on an unsecure server.    There is incontrovertible proof that Bill Clinton held an exposed secret meeting with the head of the justice department a week before his wife was to be interviewed.    Remind me again how there is no proof of an indictable offense?  Doesn't even warrant a grand jury?  Nothing to see here?  A little careless perhaps?

Two weeks later, you pass a fox news TV at the gym and she's on the set, flirting with Sean Hannity. Making diazepam jokes.  Life is good.
If the polls are close, Trump will win in a landslide. Nobody is excited about Hillary.

Trump is like the big guy in the center. He just blocked a lot and only threw a few jabs, all the while learning her pattern. Hillary was like the little guy moving around a lot and hitting the same way over and over again and getting too confident.

I wouldn't be surprised if she brought notes.  There's no accountability for her, but at this point we don't have any proof that she brought notes with her.  And, yes, she is DEFINITELY more like a robot than a concerned citizen.  Good point!!    If you watch a little more of the immediately post-debate footage, the guy who picked up the notepad acts really strange.  He hovers by the side of the stage with a big folder in his arms, then crosses the stage just in time to interact with Lester Holt.  It's very weird and I'd like to know who he is.
 That narrative.  Those marching orders. 
We need to bring the whole thing down.
Yep. That first debate was like the first round in a 3-day golf event. Just sizing up the opponent(s).
My favorite is, for decades dems wanted a maternity leave program, then Trump offers one and they immediately deaminize and trash it.

You're right, Comey said in the beginning that there were maybe 3 different types of immunity offered.  And at [1:25 min in](https://youtu.be/ZIL38se8nzM?t=4890) Issa corrects Comey's statement about no transnational immunity and claims that both Clinton lawyers and the two IT guys Brian and Paul were all given a transaction immunity from 'destruction' of data.   Comey said he didn't recall any transaction immunity again, and Issa said he was hard for congress as well as the FBI won't let them take the immunity deals out of the SCIF lol.  They can't just accidentally email them!     Issa finally asks Comey is the transnational immunity covering destruction of data is limited to the laptops themselves or not.  Comey doesn't directly answer.  
I'm naming my next dog Pepe.  Fuck it. I'm RENAMING my current dog Pepe.
Agreed. I think it is a sign of them mostly being worried now that Trump is at the final stages of the election.

I never thought about it like that. It's a way to censor/silence their opposition.

Yeah, the methodology is somewhat weird, but then again the same can be said for many other polls, like that CNN poll.   This one has 38% Democrats.  This number will include the 6% very liberal, the 12% somewhat liberal, and 20% from the moderates.  This means that the sample of independents in this poll is probably conservative, which gives it a Republican skew.

These last few months of Obama are going to go really badly for him.   I really think we're going to start seeing some serious crybaby shit from him very soon.   Especially after Trump wins the election and Obama is a lame duck for a couple months, while he has to sit there and grapple with the fact that America rejected his 'change' and his legacy will be one of failure.   He's not going to go down silently. This man is a political fanatic and a radical globalist.   I can't wait to see those salty Obama tears

"Well we all really need to ask ourselves, why do some folks prefer not to have kids? They're costly, some folks are concerned they won't be able to raise them right or in conditions that the country would be under hillary, that it wouldn't be a childhood one could cherish."

This shows everyone that Obama is a PoS that doesn't care about America.
&gt; the vast majority of employers care more about their bottom line than any prejudices against women they hold  I don't know much about this topic--just reading along here.  But it seems you've shown exactly why equal pay legislation is a fraud.  As you stated, it is not necessary.  Furthermore, it introduces an artificial "boost" to the pay rate of women; as he said, statistically, companies get more value from hiring a man.  The artificial boost gives employers a reason to avoid hiring the women!  Whereas they would have no problem bringing them on at a rate lower than the men, where the value is more comparable.
From my understanding:  It's not unconstitutional, a local rogue judge that was removed from the case for judicial ethics violations ruled it as such. Her ruling was upheld until the appeal was filed and it never was AFAIK due to the new mayor.
The first one was extremely painful, I couldn't finish it. The second one, she was certainly very passionate. I loved when she said, "when America has a cold, African Americans have pneumonia."
It doesn't matter, everyone under Hillary's umbrella can't be touched.  You've got to wonder how many people that represents...

I'm from Sweden, and I can tell you Sweden was never completely cucked.   The anti immigration party 'The Sweden Democrats' (SD) are looking to have a majority of the seats by the next election in 2018, and this hasn't happened since 1968 when the 'Social Democrats' ruled. The backlash is starting to hit really hard after the ruling coalition promised to boot out 80 000 migrants this year and have failed to even remove 10 000 so far. This is just one of many examples of failures.  The establishment keep making anti immigration policy promises and keep backing down as they fail (by design). At first because for this it seemed like 'SD' were stagnating, but recently they have started picking up speed in the polls who have shown no bias.  I was banned from /r/sweden some time ago due to calling Russians who want to invade Gotland (large island in the Baltic ocean) goatfucking invaders.

I'm sure a sign doesn't count in the same way that lawns, steps and doorways do. The intent of the law is so noone will be injured rendering emergency services or hurt in the event that you die before deactivating traps.

So what if the law only punished you if the person was on the property legally? These laws where burglars can sue the homeowner if they get hurt while breaking in are ridiculous.
In Washington at least it is completely legal to electrify your signs, someone here did it and had a camera and caught someone trying to take their sign, the person was charged with trespassing and no charges against the home owner. 1.5 joules and it has to be pulsating so they can leave if they want. I'm going to hook mine up to the dog fence so that if you try to take it off the property it shocks you. Not to touch it but to remove it from my yard it does

&gt; I did not. I'd never say that about anybody. Our business is never to decide whether someone is -- whether we believe someone -- our business is always to decide what evidence do we have that would convince us not to believe that person. It's an odd way to look at the world, but it's how investigators looks at the world.  There is nothing odd about that Comey, when I decide whether someone has told the truth I also use evidence.
No need for any power lines to the sign if you can scare them off with a warning.
Fuck that bitch, but in all fairness, he didn't hand it to Holt. He switched the folder to his left hand thinking he was going to shake hands with Lester but they ended up doing a head nod instead of a shake. Sorry, but there is nothing to this story. They are allowed to have notes at their podium, so a manila folder doesn't mean anything.   
Forgot about this one, amusing.
The "cuted" comes from executed.  It literally means execution by electricity.

That's right --I think the case where that guy raped the young girl and Hillary got the guy off as his lawyer--when she knew for a fact he was guilty.  I saw that too.  Hillary was laughing about it in an audio recording but I saw a printout of some records for what u are referring to specifically.
The left probably fantasize about having absolute control like in North Korea, it's probably their end goal.
Reminder at least 200 people at every rally are media and freelance photags and there because it's their job. The rest are interns and students mandated to attend. Maybe 8 people show up willingly.
#AIRHORN!!!!
My only argument against this, is that it's just so obvious...  I mean, you'd think they'd figure out a less blatantly obvious system if they were intending on signalling the moderator.  They knew that there would be split screen cameras, and Hillary would be visible for 100% of the debate, and say what you will about her policies and things, but you don't get to her position (and avoid serious repercussions from things like the email scandal, Behghazi, etc), without being pretty smart, smart enough to know that an obvious 'signal' like that will be noticed pretty easily, and the same goes for her campaign strategists, they are not idiots when it comes to this kind of stuff...  My theory is that this is just a smokescreen, they **want** people talking about it for a variety of reasons, it takes the focus off what she was (or more specifically, wasn't) saying, it moves the discussion away from previously legitimately concerning topics such as her health, and it gives them another reason to label Trump supporters as 'conspiracy theorists' and diminish their opinions.  Incidentally, did anyone else notice that little wobble she did after she said 'Whew! OK!', following Trump's drawn out attack on her? You think that shit wasn't orchestrated? They are still working on the damage control from her weird seizure-like behavior in front of that news crew a month or so ago, and they've told her at some point in the debate if she can laugh and wobble like that, it goes a long way to helping them further explain away her health issues as just normal behavior.  Everything she does is highly orchestrated and scripted, including these 'signals' to the moderator.
Depends on your terrorist definition. Al Nusra has killed their share. ISIS  slaughtered many thousands. Half a million dead. Only way it stops is if one side wins. I don't want winners to be Wahhabis. 
The Middle East has been hot for centuries... and you're telling me NOW people decided to go crazy?  Not the fact America invaded and bombed almost everything?  Not the fact they hate America?  Not the fact there is massive civil unrest because some of their leaders were murdered and the crazies took over?  Not the fact people who hate America decided to form a group and when America left decided to start ISIS?   It was a change in weather that caused people to think "Wow! Fuck the world!" ?  Is this seriously what you're telling me? Really?

How could he be absolutely certain about the second point ("very VIP" = Clinton), and uncertain about the first (whether FBI was aware of Combetta's reddit posts when it interviewed Combetta) ?  That doesn't make sense to me.  The only way he could be CERTAIN that the "very VIP" is Clinton is if the FBI had ASKED Combetta to confirm it.  But if the FBI had ask Combetta about the identity of the "very VIP" - i.e., if the FBI had known about Combetta's reddit posts at the time they interviewed Combetta - then Comey would have been clear on this fact, rather than uncertain.  To put it another way -- Comey *couldn't* have been certain about the one thing ("very VIP" = Clinton) unless he was ALSO certain about the other (the FBI knew about Combetta's reddit posts when it interviewed Combetta).  Because only the latter would have given him a factual basis to be certain about the former.  On the other hand, if the "very VIP" *was* Obama, that drives a large hole through Comey's wall of bullshit -- a critical first step in establishing distrust in Comey, which is a condition precedent for appointing an independent prosecutor to investigate this matter, the only way this high-level corruption will ever be exposed.  Combetta has to be forced to answer these questions, or be charged with contempt:  (i) Who was the "very VIP"; (ii) Was the FBI aware of your (Combetta's) reddit posts at they interviewed you?; and (iii) Why did you suddenly try to delete two-year-old reddit posts after the existence of those posts was exposed?

It's not *that* reflective of a surface.  If it were, the whole podium would be lit, and so would Trump's. If you watch that area throughout the debate, it's clearly not super reflective just at a certain angle.

If you go and look at what they did in Haiti. They (Clintons) essentially took an active roll in everything after the hurricane. Rebuilding, economics, health and safety. Not driving the bus, but they had the road map.  They have stepped in and argued against Haitians working in American clothing factories getting a pay increase from 0.28$/hr to 0.61$/hr. It wasn't all their doing, but they had a very very heavy hand in the deal. [Sauce](http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-suppressed-haitis-minimum-wage/)  They pushed for Limes to be a cash crop. *iirc it may not have been limes* [Sauce](http://countrystudies.us/haiti/51.htm)  [Here is an article that covers most of it with working links](http://truehillaryclinton.com/clintons-destroyed-haiti/)

Sorry if these questions are stupid but I need to ask them.   1. Is there anyway for Comey to be relieved of his position without him resigning?  2. If he were to resign and a new director was appointed would the new director have the ability to re-open an investigation?   3. Watching the hearing (not sure if that's the correct word here) with Comey today there is clearly evidence of some wrong doing, is there no department that can **TRUMP** the FBI and be like, this is bullshit we are going to conduct our own investigation and get to the bottom of it?

This is what I don't understand.   The ONLY argument they have is people using VPN to change their IPs to vote more than once. And since most people aren't that savvy, and won't devote that much time/effort, this is definitely the vast minority of reddit/4chan/twitter users.   Such IP spoofing might move the polls a few points, but not create landslides like what we saw across 20 different polls.  Basically they are arguing against online GotV efforts, aka "online ground game", aka "supporter enthusiasm online"  If they want to call these online polls "rigged" because Trump supporters on social media got organized and spread info about the polls and pushed people to vote, then they might as well call every other GotV effort, both online and IRL, "rigging".   What's great is that online supporters usually trend young. Under 40 in general, but 18-30 especially.   In any other election cycle those people vote dem.   This time they're hyped for Trump, so they're voting GOP.   This baffles the MSM because objectively speaking, HRC did have a "better" performance at the debate..and yet Trump still wins.   What does this tell us?  THAT WE DONT CARE ABOUT DEBATES.   HILLARY IS STILL CORRUPT.

What was that, George Orwell? He said, "In a time of lies, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act".  Modern Leftism is more in tune with Orwell's other work "1984," about the rise of the totalitarian State (and its strict manipulation of language to limit thought and control the population).  Modern Leftists are exemplified by *1984,* whereas the alt-right is exemplified by *1776*.  One stands for freedom of speech; the other stands for suppression of speech.  Take away the Left's self-professed monopoly on controlling the language, and you deprive them of 9/10ths of their power.  This is why they hate Trump. He refuses to use their vocabulary (hence he refuses to submit to their authority). See him do it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPKuYhKanao   Trump is redpilling people and making them realize, "Hell, I don't have to submit to these self-appointed thought-policemen."

THIS. Every time you try to debate FACTS this is what you get! Deflection. Because you didn't adhere to their use of the word or terminology that fits their argument. Even though you are clearly stating facts. So they use this as an excuse to stop the discussion. And this too is why the debates and primaries were rigged!

Well just consider the fact that last week there was a guy deported five times who on his sixth visit (illegally) to our country he raped and murdered some woman then today it was on front page of r/the_Donald, some guy shot two people on his fifth visit (illegally). With a strong wall and all the fixings (microphones to detect sound, laser tech to detect heat) we will have better control of keeping people out that we don't want in. This is really something that should have been addressed at the begining of our country but it's never too late.  Every life matters right? So let's get this out of the way now before this country falls into a debt crisis that it can't handle. Also it will create some infrastructure jobs in the long term cuz this wall won't be built that fast idc what Donald says lol.

Ciao Signore Giuseppe! Come sta?
They are setting the stage to discredit the next wikileaks release. As soon as it drops they are going to push the narrative that it is a Russian cyber attack to manipulate the election. Assange has to make it clear, presuming they didn't, that Russia had nothing to do with the leaks. They seem very worried about them given the lengths they have gone to for damage limitation. Should be interesting.
One James Woods is better than that entire Hillarywood liberal crap
EXACTLY!  the impeachment wasn't over a stinking BJ.  The reason the republicans were so determined to get rid of Bill was because of his rampant, and well known pay for play schemes.  we were simply fed up with his crooked ways.    Some people say that China got as big as they are economically by stealing US corporate secrets.  but is it really STEALING when everything was purchased from the Clintons?

"Saudi Arabia says the move could cause great damage to them economically, forcing the country to sell $750 billion in treasury securities and other assets before they could be frozen by American courts."  **NOT.

Chelsea also married a hedge fund manager I think it was and I'm sure he had/millions on his on as well.   Funny how Hilary is always talking about taking money out of wall st.

I saw on other posts there's a survey from the campaign, some 'pedes had received it, but it wasn't said how come they got it, ie what they were subscribed to.  I haven't checked the website, the survey is apparently asking Trump supporters what he should focus on now .. something like that.

The Republican wants to fix domestic infrastructure (for real, not "shovel ready jobs" for donors) and jobs for Americans, and the Democrat wants new overseas wars, cheap foreign labor and unlimited free trade agreements.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.
 Goes no where.   I now realize that Donald's saving grace at the debates was that up to half the audience tuned out after the first 30 min. It was then that Hillary took over. Too late for her. Instinct and luck worked for our man this time. He will learn that PREP IS IMPORTANT. Hillary will lean first 30 min is everything. Trump's instinct and message THE BEST. His on the road campaign strategy/energy THE BEST. Debate approach LUCKY and wont work next debates. 
I love it here too, it's a shame it'll probably die out once he gets elected

Am I taking crazy pills here? You can just execute people for being assholes. He didn't physically attack her. If he did, and she feared for her life she could defend herself. 
Also, I'm shocked at the lack of effort here at the_Donald or in most places online I frequent. It seem people don't get how serious this is! Once the transfer happens it can't be undone. 
Plus there is proof of vote rigging against Sanders; so there's that.
Phew now that we got his issue of national security out of the way we can move on to things like Kardashian withdrawing her endorsement.
The left continues its war on A CARTOON FROG
Definitely, I've never said anything against that. I do however think that the thing here is that you judge Clinton supporters as "they" whilst only talking about yourself and disregard the extreme Trump supporters as trolls enabled by anonymity. My original point was how ever the hypocrisy of the title, and the general "fuck them they don't treat us with respect so why should we" trend.
&gt;2. Net Neutrality is the opposite of "Internet Freedom" if you ever hear "free" used in terms of internet its opposite of Net Neutrality. Free internet would allow ISP (Comcast, Verizon, CenturyLink, Timewarner) to set priority to which websites get preferred traffic, such as charging Netflix or Youtube per Megabyte used or slowing them down if they dont pay  I'm just curious, without net neutrality what is preventing an ISP from slowing down a website to unusable speeds if they disagree with that website?   For example if a major ISP were to be purchased by someone backing a certain political candidate and they wanted to censor Breitbart. Couldn't the ISP just throttle the connection to 1/100th the regular speed?   When I pay my Internet bill am I not paying for the bandwidth used on the network? wouldn't charging Netflix etc  for the bandwidth I've already paid for be double charging?  
Don't be so sure yet...
Eh, just looked at the FL poll. It's only Clinton +2, and they only polled like 800 people. That might be within the margin of error. Polls show FL as being really close, though I think Trump will win it.

I hope Trump really destroys her in the coming debates, I'm so pissed right now especially after going through yesterdays Congressional Hearing.

That would be a guarantee n the dumbass libs try to justify it every time. Step up the level of ridiculousness n see if they do it over a frog.
Exactly, he talks about bridges, roads, airports and yes, trains at his rallies. He even said at the debate, it would be a different story if the US had debt, but at least good infrastructure, but instead there is debt and third world conditions. This is exactly what he talks about all the time.  Donald Trump: America is crumbling in front of our eyes, trains running through stations, we need to make America great again, folks!  The liberal left: America is GREAT already, fuck you!
So trump will get to fill her position? Sounds like a good DEAL to me.
Yeah, that's the other thing.  Even if he does release stuff, the media won't give it any burn.
In the hearings yesterday there was 1 redacted name.

No we aren't -- it isn't enough. Do you look at r/politics and all? It's hopeless slander.   It's hilarious, I don't see a single anti-Hillary headline on Reddit, yet when I look at RCP there's a litany of honest, well-sourced journalism that absolutely tears into her bullshit. At least 25% of the headlines on RCP are about Clinton; why the fuck aren't they on Reddit?  Why am I profiled for posting on this subreddit?  Why am I downvoted for my beliefs, isn't that "implicit bias"?   What the fuck is going on?

The first crime Hillary ever committed was probably killing her father.  Or at least making sure a 100lb pillow was placed over his mouth when she left the room.

It's sad how many atheists replace God with government. Doesn't add up philosophically at all. 
Just wait. Trump will fix it
&gt; Its amazing how he tries to hurt our country in the last few days of his presidency.   While I generally have little (if any) respect for Obama -- IMO this particular issue really ISN'T something that can be laid so directly at his feet.  While his administration has been involved, certainly he isn't/hasn't been the "initiator" or even (at least up until now) the main driver of this "handover" -- it is something that has been in the works, and both pushed and opposed at various times by various entities and groups (or if you prefer "special interests") over the past decade and more.  IOW lots and lots of "blame" to spread around on this one.

This. One of the first things that got me about this race in the first place is that trump is pulling a Tyrion Lannister and wrapping himself in his own public vulnerabilities, while Clinton is tucking away her own inside of her person suit.   She's so fake and cringeworthy that I'm actually disappointed in the majority of the people I know
I wish he would buy a piece of land on the border and get started. T'would be epic.
I do get your point. I think our major disagreement would be that my solution would entail finding someone who holds views you like (or doing it yourself) and then building a following bigger than Milos. I guarantee if the viewpoints were more extreme you guys would get all the negative press in the world haha. My personal views are probably not even as extreme as Milos. I just REALLY hate the SJW's and see the demographic cliff we're about to fall off of. And they're gaslighting us about it. It's bullshit.  What I don't want is for the Alt Right to take the same stance as Ben Shapiro. I.E. get all mad and attack our own over ideological purity instead of doing what it takes to win. The left definitely will.   I think even to the most extreme of the stormfronters, people like Milo and Trump must be better than Sally Kohn. I'm really terrified of the SJW's winning, and implementing some form of amnesty or illegals having kids and then they win the demographics war. After that, it won't matter as we'll lose every election no matter what.  I just think that us attacking each other is terrible strategy and we need to accept the fact that there are lots of us who have completely different opinions on our movement. We just share a common goal of stopping the left from ruining our country. We can fight later as right now they have a major advantage. Even if Trump wins, it's not like deporting people (or some other solution) will be easy.
This is what I've seen in my SO's dad, who was a trump supporter before I was. He HATES Hillary and is really pissed at millenials for failing to see beyond the curtain.

I really demand that the people making this statement follow through
The next debate won't have happened yet is my point. 
Doesn't this imply that she's giving a 100% vote of confidence to Trump? Esteems his judgment so highly that she considers him the only president in the last quarter century worthy to pick her replacement?
I think 3 dead. I read that in one report but those numbers change in the first hours. Could be less, could be more. 
Should have used #StopProjecting at the end of the video, would have made it perfect
Not all teams are doing this, hopefully one of the teams that banned it will be who wins.
And age
This is only going to win him MORE votes. Trump comes into office and gets to replace her with someone actually willing to uphold the constitution? Yes.
No Bill? Not another executive order? I've  been posting about it. Apparently, Silicon Valley supporting and pushing it. Obama is trying to screw us every which way before leaving office!

If you think about any of Trump's "scandals" for even a microsecond, you can see it's all just grasping and fabrication by political enemies and the media. They'd have been much better served by not labeling him this "extremist Hitler on racist steroids" and they're too pot committed to back out now.  There was a 30 minute hit piece about Trump on NPR about, I shit you not, a painting he bought. Investigative reporters worked round the clock to find a painting that Trump allegedly bought with charity money, and finding it meant it was worth telling the whole country to... prove why he'd make a bad president?

There are many many people like you and I. I agree with 100% of your post. Looking back at it, I prefer Trump over Bernie anyway. I can honestly say I was under the impression that Trump and his supporters were just racist and angry whites. I didn't even give him a chance until I went and saw him which thankfully un-cucked me. I'm a social liberal who thinks BLM, radical Islam and Illegals need to be stopped and treated for what they truly are. I love America and want the middle and working class to grow and honestly now I know Bernie would have never done it and Trump was the right choice all along. MAGA

Great points, risk obsessed indeed. I still feel the firewall that existed between commercial / investment banks is why we never had the levels of systemic risk we have now (post glass steagall) Tax payers money shouldn't be backstopping high alpha cowboys who take capital from commercial side (which should and is sort of backstopped) and find ways to feed the high risk / high reward side of the banks. (which should not be able to take down the commercial side upon failure).   Just my 2c  
Iv'e seen these idiots before.   Instead of making a good backup of the item they wish to test a new product on, they just use the only copy they have.   This particular dumbshit knows nothing about how computers work so it's probably going to be a really easy trail to follow.   I hope PRN goes bankrupt over this debacle and closes shop.   I hope every client they have jumps ship to another IT services provider.   We don't need any more incompetent IT shops like that shitting up the internet any more than it already is.
Posting my letter for those asking.   NOTE: I make mention of the fact that I'm a software engineer. So keep in mind if you copy pasta lol. I also removed my name.  -----------------------------------  Dear Attorney General Reyes,  &amp;nbsp;  Firstly I'd like to thank you for your service to our great State of Utah. I come to you with a matter of great importance to not just myself, but many Americans. That matter is President Obama's giveaway of ICANN to foreign powers.  &amp;nbsp;  I urge you to join the Attorney Generals of the States of Arizona, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Texas in their effort against this transfer of internet governance to powers that would not have the best interests of American Citizens in mind.  &amp;nbsp;  As you may already know, ICANN is responsible for the coordination of IP addresses around the world or as stated on their website: "the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, which are key technical services critical to the continued operations of the Internet's underlying address book, the Domain Name System (DNS)."  &amp;nbsp;  ICANN claims on their site that their transfer to the UN would not allow for the loss of our internet freedoms because: "The United States Government's contract with ICANN does not give the U.S. any power to regulate or protect speech on the Internet." They also state that: "The IANA functions are technical – not content – based. The freedom of any person to express his or herself on the globally interoperable Internet is in fact enhanced by the transition moving forward. ICANN is not, has not been, and by its Bylaws cannot become, a place for regulation of content."  &amp;nbsp;  The Attorney Generals of the aforementioned states assert that the proposed transfer of ICANN "...would consign the critical function of governance to an international community, ... rendering the Web vulnerable to censorship by foreign powers, despite what the rules say.".  &amp;nbsp;  ICANN's admission that their bylaws protect against such abuse would be comforting if it were not for the fact that investigations have shown: "ICANN has a documented history of ignoring or operating outside of its governing bylaws, In addition, even under NTIA’s [National Telecommunications and Information Administration] oversight, ICANN’s current practices often foster a lack of transparency that, in turn, allows illegal activity to occur." The other Attorney Generals also add that "Nothing protects the Plaintiffs from additional occurrences of ICANN oversight failures or actions outside of ICANN’s bylaws that could expose Plaintiffs to significant expense or harm through illegal activity".  &amp;nbsp;  ICANN's claim of being on the technical side rather than the content side also does little to assuage fears. Being a Software Engineer, I know all too well how much power is afforded to them being on the "technical" back-end. If corruption were to occur, censorship merely would be a matter of IPs no longer directing a user to where they expect to them to go; entire websites could become inaccessible. When asked, it could be framed as domain or IP conflicts.  &amp;nbsp;  Again, I urge you to join the other Attorney Generals in this effort to protect our freedoms that we enjoy as Americans; freedoms that extend to the internet which we rely on everyday for our news, communication, business, and sharing of ideas.  &amp;nbsp;  Thank you for your time and God bless,  &amp;nbsp;  \- [NAME]  &amp;nbsp;  Sources:  https://www.icann.org/  http://thetruthdivision.com/2016/09/boom-globalist-internet-agenda-halted-four-states-take-obama-court/
Holy shyt Mike!!   That is some corrupt fascist activity right there!!
She was very probably given the questions a week in advance so she could practice a speech for each one. The reporters that saw the NBC intern deliver them to Clinton's campaign office are evidence of this. Beyond that, I don't think this shows much, even if something was going on we can't know based on what we see in this video.

would be much lol, if the video was literally just clinton saying "I hate dem niggers."
That's exactly what I was wondering. Why is he being upvoted?
Because this basically nullifies Obama's authority to be able to give it away it all. The premise is that in doing so it would violate the United States foundation of free speech in giving rights over where this speech could be removed. In doing that he would be operating outside of the constitution which is not within his power. Thereby this charge places a halt on him being able to sign the rights of the internet over to the UN. Also, it being the states suing the federal government it wouldn't be in any federal courts. It goes straight to SCOTUS, no different than when Oklahoma sued Colorado on Marijuana going over state lines.
Adding she was stoned at the time of the announcement 
I never thought I'd be giving money to a presidential candidate either but about a month ago I realized that if I woke up on November 9th and Trump wasn't president that our county would essentially be at an end and I would have done nothing to save it (except vote in a red state). I knew I had to do whatever I could to help. Otherwise I'd know that I had a chance to MAGA and totally took it for granted and didn't even try to save my country.

Trump became wildly popular because he was distinctly right-of-center. Now, all these fuckheads are telling him to cool it and "act presidential." What they don't understand is that we've had weak leaders for so long that "acting presidential" is akin to being a gigantic uncontroversial pussy. I want Trump to be Trump, not some marionette controlled by limpdick blueblood strategists. He can't win by appearing moderate, and I hope he realizes that.

You're right. But it's easier to stomach if you assume they're all bought. 
Using /dev/random in this way will not only run slowly because it's waiting on entropy to be produced but also deplete your entropy pool and make other crypto applications run more slowly. There are far better tools available for the job. Maybe you meant /dev/urandom which is a PRNG but there are still better ways to do it.  edit: also, writing /dev/zero in between random writes is totally extraneous. If this is really what you do, you could be doing the job tens or hundreds of times faster.
Look up operation fast and furious. Our current administration actually armed Mexican cartel members. We are arming ISIS with the same failed logic that we will know who the bad guys are when they start killing people. This is after we destabilized Egypt, Libya, Syria, Iraq, etc., etc. This giant stinking pile of failed states is in Israel's backyard. **It is going to cause Israel grief.** She does not want to destroy Israel's enemies, she wants to sell guns and ammo to a never ending war.   We negotiate with Iran as if they never lie. They will get the bomb with Hillary in office. Why did the Russians want that Uranium deal she helped the with ? They have plenty, we have been buying old warheads to convert into fuel rods. Would they sell to Iran ? Would she stop it ?    Hillary is a champion for SJW Marxists. They will support Palestinians causes against Israel, accusing Israel of apartheid. Facts will not matter, your country will be tried in the court of opinion on Twitter.  In short I can see no benefit to Israel from a Clinton presidency. **President Trump** has great affection for Israel. If you care about Israel it would be stupid not to vote for him.

That's part of their job description, to be a tie-breaker.  Are they supposed to influence the election months in advance though?
Thank you for saying this! It must have been the sigh heard across the world because my father, boyfriend and I all did a sigh too. Then my dad started laughing in amazement  because this is the first time he has ever seen a campaign like Trump's! Everyone I know is so fired up right now!

I recently became a fan.  Reason being, Clinton's economic policies. For some stupid reason, she insists on implementing the same shit that ruined the economy under Carter, a mistake almost repeated by Bill Clinton until he backed off when he realized he was wrong.  Economic growth has been garbage relative to previous periods over the past 8 years. But it is growing at a sustainable rate, even if it is nothing to write home about. Clinton wants government expansion and large spending increases, which as history shows us if implemented when the economy is stable or growing has the potential to create stagflation or cause recession.   I for one know I cannot afford another economic downturn, nor can the millions of Americans who will become unemployed during such an event.

At the end of a project, if there were errors &amp; omissions, delays, etc, everyone is looking for some way to squeeze some extra money out of the Owner.

While Hillary visited your safe space Trump was flying from state to state to speak at sold out rallies and events.  Maybe if Hillary was made to answer a God-damn question about her past in a fucking ACTUAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE Trump would feel compelled to come pay a visit to your show.

Had enough of that shit.    Pissing away our leverage, authority, unique characteristics that made us the chief source of invention and innovation on this planet?  Screw that.   Trump has reinvented the Republican Party.  It has evolved and changed to meet the challenges of our time.  The democrat party is calcified in place with the second string candidate of yester-decades and convoluted and moronic codes that accomplish NOTHING.  
Megyn Kelly may actually just be a moron, eating this all up.  These latest attacks are obviously being coordinated to paint Trump as a sexist and make women and fat people reconsider voting for him.  When you get to the bottom of these accusations, they're basically shaming him for being involved in businesses where appearance matters, like entertainment and hospitality.  It's idiotic.  It's also part of the creeping reverse-sexist culture that tacitly allows women to be critics of men's appearance, but shames men for ever commenting on a woman's appearance because all women are God's special, beautiful creatures.   Only someone who is a complete moron is going to be influenced by a smear campaign like that, but there are a lot of morons out there.

I think comments like this are interesting, but when someone like the 4Chan AnonFBI guy posts, people say he is full of shit. Damned if do and damned if don't.

It airs at 11am est mon-fri. The only people who can watch it at that air time are stay at home moms and the unemployed. It's commercial slots are probably filled with ads for ambulance chasing lawsuit lawyers and for-profit online "universities" targeting those same groups of people.   That's who the show targets.

-- Would you say you're a cultural Muslim or a religious Muslim?    -- Which part of the world did your parents immigrate from ?   -- Do you see any (positive) similarities between Trump and the values he represents, and values associated with your parents' culture / the culture of their homeland?

And family :( 
If anyone brings up the miss piggy thing trump allegedly said, just remind them about how Obama took Sarah Palins joke about hockey moms and lipstick and made a joke to a national audience about putting lipstick on a pig (yes I know it's a saying but he knew what he was doing and it was clearly a Palin put down) and just have them look up some of the really horrible sexist things they said about Palin all over the media like bill maher Calling her a twat. Just remember that and all the bullshit Hillary did dragging all her husbands victims through the mud and defending a sexual predator when people tell you about the republican war on women or how sexist trump is. 
I meant for us. Thats the next thing they wil do to us.
How on earth could they have predicted that he would win?  If anything they would have gone with someone like Jeb or Marco.

Which means he has taken the electoral college lead. 
I cracked up at that one. I don't remember it from the first time around.
This is just the beginning steps they're taking to steal this.  The FBI have already proven that they're corrupt &amp; with Clinton.  This whole thing smells of bullshit &amp; I don't trust it. 
I seen a picture of it on the internet, so it must be. Call Don Lemon, he'll be glad to receive the scoop on this story I'm sure. 
Why  you in hospital? 
&gt;Lolololololol.  &gt;"I was against the war in Iraq."  &gt;"The record shows otherwise."  &gt;*queue grainy radio interview*  &gt;"Are you for the invasion of Iraq."  &gt;in the most offhanded non committal response.  &gt;"...yeah, I guess so......"  &gt;No other evidence of his support for the war in Iraq. A radio interviewer asks him a question about a completely unrelated topic. He obviously hasn't given it a lot of though, and gives a rather non-committal answer.  &gt;Not only that, but the record does show a lot of other instances following this interview where he has been very outspoken against the war in Iraq.  &gt;So Trump is asked a question in regards to a topic he hadn't really thought about. He gives a non-committal, but admittedly affirmative answer. He then goes on to find out more about the subject, and develops a strong opinion on the war in Iraq. Against it.  &gt;Numerous other interviews, newspaper articles, etc where he is vocally against the war.  &gt;Yet Hillary and her campaign are very dishonestly trying to force this narrative on the man. One that clearly flies in the face of logic, common sense, and basic decency. I think Trump and Clinton are both disaster candidates, but trying to pretend that Trump was for Iraq, and always for Iraq is really being dishonest, and disingenuous. And Clinton and her Campaign KNOW that they are being dishonest.  &gt;So yeah, Clinton and the MSM continue to lie, distort and spin. Yet its totally going to backfire. The presidential candidate is literally colluding with the media, and illegally with her superpac, to fucking GASLIGHT her opponent.   &gt;That's disgusting.  &gt;This Hillary Clinton ad is honestly going to benefit Trump. It just proves the media lies and distorts events to benefit their cause. They have no morals or conscious about it.  &gt;Exactly what Trump has been saying about them the entire time. They are playing into his hands by dishonestly trying to paint him as a liar.  &gt;.  &gt;Its like someone trying to tell you that your favorite color is red, when its blue. You know its blue, its always been blue, you use blue everywhere, and there is a lot of evidence of your favorite color being blue. But whenever you say, "No, you're an idiot, my favorite color is blue." some fucking asshole plays a clip of someone asking you the question, "Do you like the color red?", you responding "yeah I guess so". Then saying, "SEE, your favorite color is red. You fucking liar."  &gt;I don't know why, but the scenario he is currently in with this one issue is just mildly infuriating to me. If I was in it myself, I would be absolutely livid. Honestly, how fucking dare some assholes in the media try and tell ME what I believed. I would lose my shit if someone tried that, and I kind of legitimately respect Donald Trump for maintaining his composure in that situation as much as he did. I would have walked over and slapped Lester Holt. Especially because this entire "supported the war in iraq" narrative only started a month ago when someone stumbled across that old Howard Stern video, and every fact checking website has suddenly used it as the new "gold standard" of having an opinion on something.  &gt;In all honesty, I expect a lot of other people would have an empathetic response to seeing another person have have an entire media machine gaslight their own fucking beliefs. Not gonna be surprised when this backfires.  &gt;(sometimes you just have to go on an unnecessary rant about a stupid topic.)   well here is my dumb comment, that I guess was deleted?  Never had that happen before.   So yeah that was a strange after work rant in case anyone wanted my take on a specific aspect of the debate that really **triggered** me.  Seriously, someone needs to form an actual 'alt-right' and just troll the SJWs and liberals by using their own language against them.

Reminds me of a theory of mine.  People like to hate on hipsters but they have trouble articulating what they don't like about them.  The problem with hipsters is they imitate the style of previous masculine generations without any of the content;  punk rock, lumber jack, truck driver, early 20th century suit wearing working class.    The hipsters don't realize that the fashion styles were a practical representation of the men's lifestyles and beliefs.  Form followed function.  The hipsters wear these styles that had deep practical roots as simple fashion statements and to be unique snowflakes.

You clearly have not met the horrible violent intolerance of the regressive left. Especially when one is gay they are expected to "fall in line" with the regressive left, its actually quite oppressive and the fear of losing your job and having your entire social life destroyed just by supporting DJT can be frightening.
Now I'm wondering what's going to happen to you in the 2040's.   
I will bet my entire life's savings that your 'entire social life' has not in any way been negatively impacted by supporting the most popular presidential candidate.

I've worked in a number of small businesses and some times you need to not pay people for doing shitty jobs. Trump has been in business and in the spotlight for decades. Why do people automatically take the word of the contractors, some are talented and absolutely the mother fucker you want on the job, some are shady scum bags selling fuckery. I would much rather work for someone with the balls to say no to fuckery on the customer or contract side.   I have heard stories of Trump go through the kitchens when he tours his properties shaking everyones hand and giving everyone 2 hundred dollar bills, thanking them for a being amazing. I've heard people call into [radio shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2xkV4pXIvw), contractors saying how trump would come down to a building sight, joke with the guys, then have a restaurant do catering for the crews. These visits inspired the crews to work harder and longer, finishing the project **Under budget and ahead of schedule.** He said everyone wanted in on a "Trump job." It was about the morale and the leadership.   Maybe he stiffed some people, maybe they were trying to sell him fuckery.  Which would be fairly consistent with his whole tough negotiator pitch.

It's definitely less cucked than most states. You still have cucked people but hardly anyone who likes Hillary. A lot of "third party" voters but the majority will vote Trump. I'm very open about my Trump support, even at work, and receive no flak (usually).
That's pretty fucked up. And they never stop to think "hey who's really being violent and oppressive right now?"
[removed]
Actually ... they will :\  Hillary unfortunately has a base of people that will vote for her *no matter what*. Absolutely no matter what. There is no need to go to any rally, or buy her book, or anything. They knew that they were going to vote for her the day she resigned in 2012.

I'm not *actually* worried that any US President will suddenly go crazy and launch the nukes on a random whim, the system is set up so that other people can disobey anything that's obviously completely crazy. (If I had to pick someone I thought *might* go genuinely crazy in the Oval Office, it would be the lady who has already had brain damage.)  
The insanity and the gaslighting of the violent left have got me feeling hopeless tonight. The fact that they are literally spending time in college classrooms teaching about the alt-right white supremacist symbol, Pepe, is not funny to me.

Democrats outnumber Republicans by 3% (29% to 26%) with the rest being independents. As such, any poll which does not reflect this proportion is skewed, at least for a nationwide poll. For state polls it should reflect the proper demographics.

Thanks for the breakdown and the education. Sounds like a big ton of work. It has to be frustrating to spend all of that effort and time only to have to do it all over again with a new set of victims after the rapists get out, all because the immigration enforcement isn't there.    Sure, we have control while they're serving time, but once we deport them, they come right back, hidden in shadows, and then we're at it again with more devastation like what happened to Kate Steinle. I'm really looking forward to having a president that doesn't tolerate such lawlessness. Carry on and MAGA, friend.

No - there has been a case (Nixon I think) where he was immediately pardoned for all potential crimes known and unknown during his presidency. They should get rid of presidential pardons. Clinton pardoned his own brother for all his misdemeanors from years earlier.  I think Obama will do it

As I've said before: Fuck USA Today. We get that rag every day at my job, and it has NEVER had a single article critical of Hillary. Not one. To see them joining the cuck train is pathetic, but not entirely unexpected.
The debate wasn't intended to sway existing voters for Trump, it was to show that he can be calm and presidential to the large percentage of undecided voters. Many Trump supporters said he lost the second half, however during the second half Clinton attacked him as being a racist/sexist while he backed down and said it was disgusting and that he won't engage which worked out for the better.

I'm going to push you on your second answer, if you don't mind.  "It's up to god to punish you, not me"  Sharia, of course, would not require YOU to kill anybody.  Would you think this country is a better place if proper Sharia courts were established in certain regions where the proper Muslim authorities could have PROPER Sharia trials... and if in one such trial sufficient evidence was brought forward to demonstrate that the kind of apostasy that was committed was the kind that Sharia provides the death penalty for (knowingly blaspheming after knowingly and sincerely following the way of submission, etc.)... and the proper authorities would be free to follow the law as dictated to the prophet by Allah and sentence to a death carried out by proper Sharia executioners?  Would that be a good thing?  I'm sorry to have to be so specific, but we have all known Muslims personally who have used dishonest tricks to tell us that THEY would never kill anyone only later to find out that they believe certain people should be executed if they are gay or an apostate or a polytheist or whatever provided the proper sharia judge sentences in the proper way etc.  Another way of asking the question:  As a Muslim, do you believe that the best of all possible societies is the one regulated by sharia, as handed down to the prophet through the archangel Gabriel sent by Allah, and do you interpret that to mean that in the best of all possible societies apostasy could be a capital crime?  Or do you think good Muslims should be reinterpreting the holy texts with their best understanding of what is good?

I agree, this does make it harder to rig, because you have to rig multiple states, but Crooked Hillary's corruption knows no bounds.   George Soros even stated this in a public interview, that the election has already been decided, and that the electorates will go for Clinton regardless.  
&gt; I would love to see a policy that allows "star gender" but excludes "his majesty."  Well there are only TWO ways to enforce any such policy:  1. A "white-list"\* -- a limited set of *acceptable* pronouns; or  2. A "black-list"\* -- a listing of *unacceptable* pronouns.  Either way they're in for a shitstorm; because there are ENDLESS ways to "fuck with" either of those.  Allow "star gender" but forbid "your majesty" and the person then simply says OK, instead of "your majesty" I want to be called "Milord" or "your grace" or "your honor" or "Massa" or... we can keep going all day (and then tomorrow we can go for the "difficult/impossible to pronounce" letter &amp; {foreign language symbol} combinations, "N!gbkmbfh!xtx" -- or Klingon, Romulan, etc... the possibilities are endless).  Plus any and every option that is REJECTED will have to have some "appeal" process that can be proverbially DDS'ed.  -- What they'll end up doing is just accepting/rejecting based on OTHER "discriminatory" bases -- basically sexist/racist ones.  **This is going to be fun to watch...**  --- \* And of course, LOL they would DARE NOT use the terms "whitelist/blacklist" -- even though that's what you call such things.

Is that young Dangerous Donald? 
I'm gonna need that "Trump Wins" in gold, with sparkle and some lens flare, thank you.
Why specifically are you voting for him?
It does sound odd, but that's how he described it to me, so I just went with it.

#TRUMP
O H!!
it's like when Neo starts to see glitches in the Matrix. 
People are free to support or vote for either candidate. If our elections weren't rigged by both parties to keep them and their pals in power, then I'd be confident in Trumps landslide victory, because he is the people's choice, by a long shot. But our system is rigged. Our government is owned. Our media is owned. Our democrat president is about to forfeit control of the Internet and the republican congress is going to sit back and let it happen. Their propaganda machine is almost complete. Once they can truly control the Internet, that is, by letting some other government, not constrained by our constitution, control the Internet, they will have unthinkable control over the globe. Next will be their new global currency. Digital. Completely controlled by the elite. There will be no discussion of rebellion by anyone, as that will be a crime punishable by death. There will be no secrets, because there will be no privacy. Phones, televisions, and countless other gadgets with built-in cameras and microphones will be constantly surveilling us. Giving gays the right to marry, legalizing marijuana; these types of things won't happen in the future because the discussions won't take place. Sigh. Please MAGA Don.

He wants people to go out of their way to do their own investigating about the matter. That way, people see how the liberal media uses these people as martyrs no matter if they were right or wrong.

I don't want any kind of religious groups ran by schools but if they want to allow space to be used by groups regardless of affiliation I'm okay.   It's like prayer before football games. If a group wants to pray before the game let them but don't say not to pray, don't say other religions can't pray, and don't make everyone pray. It's an individual choice to associate and practice whatever religiosity they want. The government and government ran schools can provide space for your group to gather for whatever purpose your group wants but it can't and shouldn't tell one group different from any other.

I went to the dentist 2 weeks ago with some bad teeth pain. Wasn't sure what I was looking to do about it, but I could barely almost go in fear that I'd have to be awake whille getting some teeth pulled.   The dentist would definitely be described as having no bedside manner. He was factual and blunt. I was blown away by it, but my reaction was to embrace what he said because he's the pro and he was confident.   I went there with the expectation that I'd never be awake having a tooth pulled, and left with literally no pain after several teeth were removed in just 10 minutes. This guy saved me thousands in work and did it faster than I take to drive to work. (Ahead of schedule, under budget!)  I think of this story because the guy reminded me a lot of Trump in his demeanor. Also, during the pulling I started humming to cover the noises and he started humming the national anthem! What a patriot!  The truth may hurt, but it's the truth. To run from it will solve nothing, and the people that understand that are the people that can help make America (and for some, my mouth) great again!

sorry to hear that journalists think my masters in engineering is "less educated" than the urban baristas.  Their world is crashing around them.
&gt;Remember, under American law, hate speech is not protected speech.  Pretty sure it is...  &gt;Yes, you're right, someone could always go to 104.16.72.120 to find Trump's website. Until Phase II of the globalist plan, restricting DNS resolution to "approved" sites only, or blocking the international routing of non-approved sites. Yes that sounds silly, but there are serious forces in the world that have this in mind. And I'm not even a tinfoil hat guy! None of this is far-fetched at all. The potential for the loss of yet another little bit of our freedom is tremendous. And we get absolutely nothing in return.  It's a legitimate fear, you don't have to say "well I'm not a conspiracy theorist"  Conspiracies happen, and countries DO pull this shit. From now on all you should have to do is point to one example where something like it happened and the worry is legit.  Certain countries censor the internet. The threat is legit.

The Dems also have done a similar media blackout on Jill like they did to Bernie. MSNBC talks about Gary Johsnon more than Jill even though his voter base is even more wildly different from MSNBC's audience than Trump, because they know plenty of pissed off Bernie people are just barely hanging onto the Hillary Train.   If the media let them know they have another radical Marxist named Jill Stein whom they could vote for, plenty would. Then Hilary would lose 30% of her voter base.   As usual, the DNC is using it's influence to subvert democracy. It's so outrageous anyone still calls them "Democrats" since democratic seems to be the least accurate word to describe them.

Snopes forgot to report that she was quoted on air, was fired for having sex, and was dumped by her Fiance.  ___________   #SNOPES [PROPAGANDA 2016]  *WHAT'S TRUE: Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado made an allegedly risqué appearance on a TV reality show and was pictured topless in Playboy magazine.*  However, the so-called "sex tape" stemming from that incident, which is nothing more than some grainy, night-vision footage of a couple of covered figures writhing in a bed, **hardly qualifies as explicit**. And reality television being what it is, **the scene the tape depicts was quite possibly staged or fabricated.**   #REALITY PART 1 (2005-2006) - Public Sex Act Admission  Later during the broadcast replay, the show’s host read aloud what Machado had written about the man. “Really, that guy is cute, he loves me, he understands me, he accepts me, he protects me, he supports me, he respects me,’ read her testimonial. **“He treats me like a goddess, he f[UCKS]s me like a b[BITCH]!”** Machado told TV channel Univision when she returned to Miami that despite the scandal she “felt fine as a person, as a human being.*  #REALTIY PART II (OCTOBER 2009) - Public Scandal in South America  The story that went along with Alicia was kind of good. She and Bobby were all set to tie the knot in 2005 when Bobby was still with the Phillies and had won The Home Run Derby that year. Alicia Machado was crowned Miss Universe in 1996 and was a big star in Latin America. In 2005 Alicia appeared as a cast member on the Spanish celebrity reality show "La Granja" and was taped having sex with a fellow cast member Fernando Acaso. After the show aired Abreu immediately called off the engagement and ended the relationship. **It was a big scandal in Latin America and Alicia publicly apologized for her actions**. Alicia Machado also appeared in the Mexican and Venezuelan issues of Playboy in 2006. She appeared in US Playboy in 2007 and dedicated the issue to Donald Trump.  Alicia gained twenty pounds during her reign as Miss Universe that caused her humiliation when Donald Trump described her as "an eating machine."  #REALITY PART III (MARCH 2009) - Engagement to US MLB Star Called Off  “Tienes una pinga divina.”  Abreu and Machado were engaged in 2005, when Machado went on a reality TV show. The concept of being filmed for a nationwide(and with the glory that is the internet, worldwide) reality TV show apparently escaped Machado as she had sex with a housemate,… of course, all caught on camera. The photos and video appeared online, and **Abreu called off the engagement shortly thereafter.** This brings us back to our original quote, and if you haven’t gone to look up what it means yet, we’ll save you the trip. It translates to, “You have a divine cock,” which Machado moaned out repeatedly during her on air tryst.  http://www.playerwives.com/mlb/los-angeles-angels-of-anaheim/bobby-abreus-ex-fiancee-alicia-machado/  edit: these are article summaries from before the election, so this shit is not made up by Clinton PR agencies. 
So this change cedes release complete control of IANA by the American state. The thing that this really impacts is how the [root nameservers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server) for [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) are governed. This, for all intents and practical purposes means that if Saudia Arabia doesn't like something like "exposejihad.com", they could force the DNS records/subdomains to be dropped by relevant [DNS registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry) for the top level domain. While this does mean that the convenient lookup of being able to enter the "name" in goes away, it does not mean that the server is not connected to the internet anymore (it's still routable and everything).   Because the key to enforcing censorship in this way is being able to use the root servers to push pressure on the intermediary registries (and registrars) to drop politically "unsavy" end customers, one way to work around to use new/extra root servers. While there are requests for comments (RFCs) out there that discourage this, [OpenNIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenNIC) manages some of it's own top level domains, is community driven, and does not answer to IANA. If more adoption of OpenNIC (or similar) can occur, especially if normies get on board, it would potentially allow us to blunt the blow of releasing IANA, and provide a new home for more free speech.

Mods can this be sticky (ed)? 
&gt; But neither will happen just as long as corporate money is allowed to purchase votes.  Agreed.  The number 1 reason I will vote for Trump is that he single-handedly defeated the Republican field. (They needed a reset.)  While defeating them, he removed money from the equation.  Jeb Bush spent $51 million per electoral vote he received. That makes money meaningless.  Money is only controlling when both candidates are wholly corrupt.
YOU ARE UNDER ATTACK. The mainstream media is colluding **(with who)** at levels never before seen. They are telling you what to do and how to think, rather than presenting their findings for your consideration. Talking points are being echoed by every established outlet with hopes of overwhelming you with their authority and credibility. It should make you wonder, is life really this one sided? Do these companies really have the average ~~man and woman’s interest~~ [man or woman's *or* Americans' interests] at heart? I ask you to consider whether [whether or not *or* IF ]there is an ulterior motive and agenda at play. The conclusions you reach are your own. Think about who really sits on an “Editorial Board.” Are these people smarter and more informed than you? If you think they are, ask yourself why: is it because they have a degree in journalism? Is it the prestige associated with their title? Maybe it’s the respect we ought to pay someone with experience? Regardless what conclusions you reach after performing this analysis, give yourself some credit: as a human being you were born with critical thinking skills essential to your survival. Those skills are more powerful than we ~~often~~ give them credit for. Intuition, gut feelings, they mean something. That doesn’t mean they can’t be influenced or manipulated; but, if we can’t count on our own instincts, then we are lost. Vet your sources, be critical, and don’t assume that because the outlet delivering the “news” has name recognition that it speak**S** with authority. I urge you to take a moment to research the Brexit **[you should link something here]** and the failed media tactics used ~~there~~ to try and stop the citizens of the United Kingdom from regaining their country’s sovereignty. Those tactics have been updated and redeployed here in America to influence the outcome~~**S**~~ of our Presidential election. REMAIN VIGILANT.

Wait there's more! 
thats nothing, most of the time she puts all her fingers together and points and shakes it.  no normal person points like that
It's almost as if it should be a decision that is left up to the individual, and not something a government should outlaw because certain people feel a certain way about it. 
That one rally in The Woodlands only had about 2k people. I think it was a fund raiser though. Idk, I couldn't get in, the line was reported on the news at 2 miles long. I swear to god there had to of been 50k people on the streets...
So strange to think that next year it will be half of my life running with the punks. I'm 28, and slowly realizing I'm on the cusp of being an old head.   Kinda awesome haha. 
To be fair...when I went to a Trump rally in WA this summer, there were tons of anti-Trump protesters. But uh the big difference is that despite hundreds of protestors, they were dwarfed by the number of people in line for the rally :). I have a feeling there were more protestors than attendees in Clinton's case? Lol.   Plus, a lot of us just sat on the grass and watched them across the road after the rally, it was free entertainment. And a moment I liked was when a Trump supporter stopped traffic to give Hillary supporters hugs meeting in the middle of the road. That was cool--we showed them what the Trump movement is all about. Peace and inclusion and coming together as one America for all its people.   
Do you have a source? You probably mean it's been *deferred* until after the election, just like the Obamacare rate hike.

Can you give me a TLDR ELI5 on who Machado is and what the controversy around her entails?
I'm aware of that.  But that was before he challenged the establishment.
Sounds like a wonderful idea I think he has a goFund me page. 
I believe that you're incorrect in several areas.  I'm not a network expert, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.  1) Those are the root servers, but that doesn't say anything about the root-zone database, or who owns it.  From what I can gather, the US government technically owns that, and the ICANN / IANA supervises and manages it. Being that the Internet was created by and intended for the US government, ICANN is subject to the rules of our government, and also is entitled to the rights that our government hold (e.g. freedom of speech).  To put another way, the current reason that ICANN is not doing shady shit is because the highest laws by which it's governed by are just and true.  That will not be the case if handed over to the UN, where 'hate speech' and censorship are the norm.  Non-US citizens might disagree here, but again, we've got no right to tell you what to do with your property, and vice-versa.  It's ultimately our decision (the United States) as to whether we give it away or not.  Obama is currently being a dick if he just hands it away.  The litigation going on to prevent this, is a good thing IMO.  2) ICANN supervises and manages everything that you listed.  Even if those parties manage their own root servers, ICANN is the group that supervises and manages it at the highest level, coordinating that all of the root servers are not stomping on each other. Also, [l.root-servers.net](http://l.root-servers.org/) is run by ICANN, so there's the possibility that it could get completely hosed or used for shenanigans or fuckery, if some sociopath got ahold of it, no?   3) ICANN does have certain authority to de-register domains and can refuse registration.    4) ICANN / IANA coordinates whether certain TLD's exist or not (root-zone database).  Maybe the future UN-controlled ICANN / IANA doesn't want to recognize Elbonia as a country any more, so they remove .elb from the database.  That would be censorship.     I could go on, but let's start there.

What makes you think they aren't as reliable?   If anything them not needing to be propped up by subsidies make them more reliable. Right now there aren't as many because (due in large part to subsidies and asinine regulations) it isn't as lucrative to own a small farm. If large farms were no longer propped up as much and regulations were lifted or clarified to actually make sense (organic chicken regulations are especially punitive to the small farmer) there would be more small farmers.   The are also more reliable in a grander sense as that engaging in polyculture is much more disaster resistant. A small farmer with a bad year of squash bugs is far better off than the pumpkin farmer who encounters a pesticide resistant year of squash bugs. Monoculture farmers are one generation of insects away from having a crippling year whereas the small farmer still has a great year in other areas. Those in the livestock industry are worse - remember how much chicken eggs jumped up this last year due to disease?   And of course lets not forget that large farms lost are never regained. Reliance on large farms will eventually fail us regardless because one by one farms are being sold to wealthy hobbiest or developments. The number of 1,000 acre plus farms that are actually bought to be used for monoculture farming is pretty dismal. Clinging to the large farms will only fail us because in the long run people are too detached from their food to really care about the cultivation of it.  And you do not make stuff that adds onto other things that go straight to table, you are skipping a great many steps there. That wheat has to be taken to a facility where it is first turned into flour which is then sold to a bakery where it is turned into bread and sent to a grocery store where it THEN goes to the table. Soy beans and corn are just as bad in that respect. Now a small farmer on the other hand can grow the wheat, thresh it, grind it, bake it, and directly sell the bread without any part of it having to leave the property before it is bread.

Still one of the weirdest things and its really the after-story, the excuses, the bizarre 'chirpy refreshed' Hillary who out-of-nowhere is walking and whistling down the street picking flowers for a lil' orphan girl. Then she has a serious illness and needs a week. but also she was spending 2 weeks preparing for a debate. wow.  But now that its been more or less determined she's taking 'Provigil' I wonder if anyone knows the downside to that drug?  It seems like you can't 'cheat nature' and while the Provigil seems to get her jacked and clear for at least 40-90 minutes at its peak does she have to sleep for 16 straight hours at some other point?

Hey guys I have something to share about Trump. It really changed my life.  When my wife was 19, she was in a very serious car accident. Along with a broken hip and series of fractures, she had significant nerve damage. Thankfully, she wasn't paralyzed in any way, but she does have nerve issues on the left half of her body, not unlike a stroke victim. Being so young, she was able to adapt very well, and you can’t tell anything’s wrong by looking at her. However, along with a litany of lifelong medication, she was told she could never bear a child. Now, this happened before I met her, so I was aware and accepting of the fact when we got married.  In 2008, after three years of marriage, we were shocked when some routine blood work came back showing that she was pregnant. Her periods were always very irregular due to her health issues, but she was already three months along. The doctors were very careful not to be optimistic, and prepared us for the worst, but my wife carried to term and we had a healthy baby boy, who we named Donald.  Donald's physical development was ahead of schedule, but mentally, he seemed to develop slowly, and he spoke his first word much later than most. By age three, Donald was diagnosed with autism. I won't sugar coat anything: it was very difficult and frustrating to raise a child with autism. Donald never spoke more than a few words a day, and would often seem to be in his own bubble apart from our universe.  One thing Donald loved was frogs. He stared at pictures of frogs all day, played with frog toys, and filled notebooks with drawings of frog after frog. We eventually got a glass aquarium with a few different frogs for his room. Donald loved his frogs and played with them very well. Donald became "The Frog Whisperer" in our home and I know every parent makes outlandish claims about their children, but Don really could issue a few single-word commands to his pets.  When I first showed Don a picture of Pepe on my iPad, he immediately began jumping up and down. He ran to the dining room table, and with a pencil and pad, drew a Pepe freehand. He only looked at Pepe for a second on the screen, but the recreation was eerily perfect, in that way that only autistics can sometimes seem to perform superhuman feats. I showed Donald a few more pictures of Pepe over the next couples months, but I needn't had, because he was taking it upon himself to draw rare Pepes every day.  Last year, Little Don changed again. When Donald Trump would come on the TV, Little Don would focus all his attention on the man, even if he were in the middle of doodling. This had happened before, usually with people that had very commanding voices, but Donny seemed to hear Trump in a way that he couldn't hear anybody else. When I would stream Trump rallies, Little Don would come into the den and watch with me in silence, leaving when the rally finished. As I said before, Donny never spoke much. He'd occasionally get a slogan or catchphase in his head, telling my wife and me for weeks on end that everyone loved McDonald's. So it was amusing, but not out of the ordinary, when he shouted "Make America Great Again!" when Trump came on the news. His infatuation with Trump was more extreme than any of his previous episodes, as he started rattling other phrases like "Build the Wall," "Mexico is going to pay," and "China is ripping us off in trade." In six months, he'd spoken more than he had in his entire life. We sat down with his special education teacher to talk about it. While Mrs. Tyson was telling us that anything that got him to come out of his shell should be encouraged, he approached us and said that we will no longer surrender our country to the false song of globalism.  From that day, Donny began progressing dramatically. We watched every Donald Trump video, and my son would always ask me follow-up questions, showing that he was actually comprehending the content. He still drew Pepes incessantly, but the other symptoms of his autism shrunk away. When Trump accepted the GOP nomination at the convention in July, Donny seemed completely normal.  His teachers had never seen anything like it, and after much debate, we decided to enroll Donald in a regular class this year. It's only been two weeks, but he is doing wonderfully. And despite our biggest concern, Donald is socializing and interacting with the other children very well. My wife actually burst into tears when Donald told us he made a friend at school. So, Mr. Trump, I don't know what you did, but I know I owe you so much more than my vote in November. You've given my son a chance at a normal childhood, and you've given me a sense of control in my life once again. And I while he can't vote, I know Donny supports you with all his heart. Thanks for listening, everybody. Make America Great Again!

You are completely right in everything you said. With that said, it will be very very interesting to see what happens across Europe if Donald wins. Will the media continue to attack him the same way, or slowly start accepting certain things? Not sure, but probably the former. That will be very interesting, because normally the EU is the lapdog of the US. SO that is very interesting in itself.  The other thing is how will the cultural response be, and how will it affect the populace? Will it make more people surge towards nationalism in Europe, and more parties like front national in France gets elected? If so, the collapse of the EU is very close.  That's the fight, that's what we will fight for.

Think "rouge freedom DNS servers" or a local app that writes to your localhost file (which over rides dns) where what you want is located.    Pain in ass.  Not death of free speech.  IMHO.  
I think people need to see more of our discussions, not less.  The comments section of r/The_Donald is more entertaining, enlightening, and well-sorted than any other forum in this ultraliberal shithole of a website.  To the extent the bots take away from lurkers being able to follow the actual discussion, they are a hindrance to bringing in new people.  That's my two cents 
"The six White Supremacists from left to right are Chow Mein Wang, Su Shi Wang, Soy Zhu, Dumpling Zhang, Linda Hu, and Fried Rice Lin.  They are respectively members of the American NeoNazi Party, leaders of the Pan-German White Nationalist Party, Secretary of Florida KKK, and chairwoman of White Supremacy National Club."  ~~Excerpt from CNN 
We are indeed under a propaganda war for Hillary. This is like Soviet Russia or North Korea. Everyone is shilling for Hillary and forcefully trying to brainwash people via one medium or another.   Even addons!  It is like only "Ember Alerts" are left untouched.
Now we can see how our tax dollars will be used. We need a massive db where we can collect all this outside of here incase. I bet a bunker js already constructed but worth the curiosity.

Likely done on purpose, with Hillary's post-debate line written weeks ago.   
Don't you just hate it when you get the words 'frequently' and 'rarely' messed up?  It's something that frequently happens to me.
Saw that too. 
I don't even think Hillary is over 30% Nationally going by the way she never ever has anyone come to her rallies.  I think Trump has more come to one of his rallies than she has had in total across all of hers.  I mean hell our VP crowds dwarf hers.
I will have you arrested for hate speech!
Hey how are you, hey how are you, hey how are you...
This is old in case you are wondering.
I care about just a few things. Rights, lower taxes, bandwidth, and weed. Hillary is opposed to all of them.
I am not sure about how many Babies Trump has kissed, but there are a fuck ton of Pepe (who BTW is not racist)
"Coined in the Scorsese film, 'Mean Streets', meaning a arsehole or loser."
Fact check!
Stop and frisk. The Clintons endorse the 'unconstitutional' stop and frisk used for weed. Didn't she talk about this in the debate?
Both of your links are ink to the same video, which says "removed by the user". Not calling anyone out, but whenever my videos get deleted, it says "taken down for violating..." or some shit.
Didn't they raise around $500 million? Overbudget and behind schedule. Hillary is a big fat mess.
Ironic considering the federal illegality.
I scrolled back to September 17 but couldn't find it.  Maybe it's gone?
they never stop begging for money, but you can only dream that Soros has abandoned her - because without his (and his money) protecting her she really will end up in jail.

Makes me very sad since this sort of action sounds like something that would qualify
Her only plan is to get people to hate Trump so much, in the hopes that they will vote for her by default on election day. The only problem is that hatred of Trump isn't enough of an incentive to go out and specifically vote for Hillary, which is why I think that there is a huge disparity in the amount of people saying that they support her in the polls, and the amount of people actually going out and voting for her.

Thankfully though we're getting to a generation of "counter-culture" that's pulling more to the conservative side, Trump's  movement being a prime example. Pride in your nation and the desire to defend it's core values is coming back.

In America our women play a game called "Guess which one has a Glock?"

The market will take care of it. If CNN loses any more credibility there will be other networks offering to create a special channel for airport news. Airports try to be as attractive to guest as possible. If they feel changing the network after their contract with CNN runs out for the next time, they will go for it.  If you want to speed it up, keep calling CNN out on their bullshit and complain to everyone who shows their program publically. Write emails to your airport and make sure there will be so many friendly complaints, that it will be brought up in the next management meeting about customer satisfaction.

That's why i'm out here!!!" etc...it was clear these people did not live in, but rather were coming there to harm and disrupt, the neighborhood and people who DID live there.  If we can proove Soros paid to bus in people to disrupt the peace, it is funding law-breaking and he could be brought up on RICO charges...
One thing I will never understand is why the media and BLM make such a big deal about someone being "unarmed."  Look up the video of the assassination attempt on Reagan.  Try guessing which of those men have guns before the first shots go off.  Seconds later many of those supposedly "unarmed" men have not just handguns but submachine guns pulled out.  You have to assume everyone is armed unless you can prove otherwise -- you have the suspect under control and you can search him.  It's just like doing electrical work -- treat every wire as if it's live until you have tested it.

I did that and sent myself down a path of depression.. the_donald has its fair share of shit posts which are humorous but I could live without.  R/politics though,  the hatred and just outright foaming at the mouth towards anything even remotely bad about hillary is insanity. Trump isn't necessarily the most moral man to walk the earth but we're voting for president not God.   He talks about how to actually fix the tax code and prevent American companies from going overseas and they focus on him saying a woman was fat ( then actually getting her help and defending her).. then he gets upset and they go haha look we baited him,  he's not stable.. It's like a warp back to middle school bullies, but these ones are literally psychologically unstable.

NOOOOOO NOT MY BOTS! BUY PEPE! 10 FEET HIGHER! HILLARY FOR PRISON! NO BRAKES! 
When does she say losers?
Her "misspeaking" was actually her telling the truth.  She's promised her billionaire friends (supporters) like George Soros that she won't increase their taxes by increasing the taxes on everybody else.  Also don't forget she was on the board of Walmart for six years, so she has no problems profiting from the work of wage slaves.

Police officer here that has some experience in this specific area of LE.   18 U.S.C. § 2252 states under (c) affirmative defenses:   &gt;(c) Affirmative Defense.—It shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of violating paragraph (4) of subsection   &gt;(a) that the defendant—   &gt;(1) possessed less than three matters containing any visual depiction proscribed by that paragraph; and  &gt;(2) promptly and in good faith, and without retaining or allowing any person, other than a law enforcement agency, to access any visual depiction or copy thereof—  &gt;(A) took reasonable steps to destroy each such visual depiction; or  &gt;(B) reported the matter to a law enforcement agency and afforded that agency access to each such visual depiction.  More than likely he followed subsection (A) and (B) in contacting the local ICAC Task Force and talking to them about the story as well as having them walk him or *assist* him in the destruction of the digital files on his computer.   The larger question is his adherence to section (a)(1) with regards to the total number of images he viewed or downloaded which likely would be able to be notated by the ICAC officer depending on how they handled the reporter's request and that is only if he worked with them.   His claims of sudden memory loss relating to 2007 are exceptionally suspicious if not downright devious in nature. I am trying to make this non-political but all I can think of is Clinton's 'unable to recall' answer.   He provided multiple payments only one of which he disclosed without prompting and the second disclosed one of $10 seems to be a *more standard* porn (legal) website membership fee which raises flags with me especially considering his inability to, at the time or in a timely matter after, disclose the $1100 payment.    Finally in my professional opinion of this evidence and **only** this evidence I feel this is suspicious although not necessarily illegal content. However, if the FBI and/or ICAC can not corroborate his story then it becomes a much, much larger problem.   Ask anything if you are unclear.

OUT OUT OUT! This woman needs help. She doesn't know how messed up she is.  
Indeed. Really, Harper should've seen the writing on the wall, and taken steps to avoid this outcome. His image was so distrusted and disliked, the best thing he could've done was step down, and tell his replacement that the party needed to reevaluate how it worked.  Hell, the Alberta provincial election showed that traditionally conservative voters were fed up with conservative parties. The fact that the NDP won Alberta should have been a wake up call to drastically change the course of the Conservative ship. Instead he sailed the ship directly into an iceberg he just saw a smaller ship hit, thinking he could take it on.  Don't take your voters for granted, and assume that your strongholds will always vote for you. Clinton is learning that with states that normally are not battlegrounds are turning into battlegrounds.

&gt;Either we should make alcohol and tobacco illegal (which I disagree with - I think people should have the right to choose what goes into their bodies), or we legalise marijuana.  That's a bit of a logical leap buddy. The law doesn't operate linearly, it's not "everything past this line is illegal and everything before it is legal". It doesn't work like that. "Hypocrisy" isn't the term you're like for, you're looking for the term "consistency", which is still not really all too applicable. I understand as a user of Cannabis you may not like that drugs which are more harmful get to see legal benefits the one you've chosen do not, but as I've said: One poison doesn't beget another. If they proposed a bill to make cigarettes illegal I would support it in a heartbeat: A healthy society does not desire to see its citizens poisoned. Alcohol is trickier due to the extensive history it has in Europe and the West, but a good case could be made. Marijuana however lacks the social benefits of controlled alcohol consumption, so there's again a point to be made.  &gt;What's more, unlike cigarettes and alcohol marijuana actually has medical benefits in certain situations, so while sometimes it can be very slightly harmful, at other times it can be significantly beneficial.  Alcohol also has medicinal benefits, many the same as Marijuana. It's a stimulant in small doses and a depressant at large, so it has those same properties. The case is often made that it "hurts nobody when used responsibly" but you do not legislate for the responsible, you legislate for broader society. That's why we have preventative law, to prevent situations likely to cause negative affects rather than responsive law of only punishing when the deed is done.  &gt;At the end of the day, marijuana is good for some and bad for others, and as it's effects vary on an individual basis, I think it should be up to the individual to choose whether or not to use it, not the government.  Your premise is fine, I don't agree with the conclusion. I believe many irresponsible people exist in society. I believe it is my duty as well as yours to provide social and legal framework for those people to become better people and better citizens. I am not willing to leave behind my fellow man all for the sake of the right to poison oneself.

For the town hall I think Trump should focus on the issues. It doesn't help his campaign to dredge it up.   At the third debate, if Clinton brings up his treatment of women, I agree, Trump should fire back. 
Her supporters embody it well, too. 
Her campaign was over months ago.
oh my god could you imagine how hilarious it would be if the barrage imparted some form of tact on Trump? When trump hits you, you know it then and there. Could you imagine the pants shitting that would occur if trumps wit hit everybody as they were walking for the door.

I love free speech as much as anyone, but you're always going to have to have some restrictions on free speech. Unless you think people should have the right to, say, call for terrorist attacks because that's "absolute" free speech.  There can be no such thing as absolute free speech in the same way a state can't have absolute freedom for its citizens.

there are hardworking americans who have families to care for, houses to pay for and lives to lead who get ALL of their information from whichever MSM outlet they feel most comfortable with. The MSM has demonstrably and fiercely pushed a narrative about Trump since DAY 1 that is utterly abhorrent and antithetical to everything they think they believe in. As such, we have a huge swath of the country who frankly just doesn't know any better. They are not dumb, they are just not shown the whole picture - and without being able to see beyond the veil, how would they know? Trump - or should I say the horror show the media has presented Trump *as* scares the fuck out of these people. Hillary knows all too well that if you say some shit enough times, you WILL snag some folks with the lies. Undoing that kind of conditioning is difficult, at best.
The core of Trump's campaign is Americans vs. non-Americans (illegals, terrorists, globalists, and bad trade partners).  The core of a democrat campaign is always certain groups of Americans vs. other groups of Americans (black vs. white, rich vs. poor, women vs. men, etc.)   Recently we have seen the left start to eat itself alive, like with Muslims vs. women and gays. Hillary has possibly the just driven another wedge into her own party and alienated what fragile youth vote she might have had. It really is clear she only cares about the donor class, whether they're on the right or left. She takes it for granted that so many older, rich, white partisan Democrats will still vote for her no matter what. 
Don't forget our Lord Pepe who will see us through with his Kek blessings.

I get the point you're trying to make, but both Mexico and Pakistan are extremely multicultural. Dozens of languages and ethnic groups originate in each country.   Pakistan is home to Balochis, Sindhis, Punjabis, Pashtuns, Afghans, Kashmiris, and more.   Mexico gave us such different people as Guillermo Del Toro, Salma Hayek, and Lupita Nyongo. Their richest man is of Lebanese descent. Increasing a lot of Asian immigrants too.

I agree that there is evil and hypocrisy in this particular case, but I feel like both sides of this election blow up these "evil" cases. There is evil in all things of this world, and there is good. Is evil not inherent in our world? Do you have a sense that there is some future where we can eliminate evil? Do you think that Trump is not subject to forces of evil? He is only a man, and Hillary is only a woman. It's interesting that during this election season people on both sides find one piece of "evil" and think it is enough to tell the whole story.   If it is your true belief that Hillary is pure evil incarnate, that seems like a personal perceptual phenomena rather than a genuine political thought.

The mistake here was her saying they live in their parent's basement.  Amongst the young and Internet savvy that's a way of calling people losers.  If she would have just said "they live at home with their parents" it wouldn't have sounded nearly so bad.  Because she's basically right about a lot of Bernie supporters being young and economically naive.  You almost have to be economically naive to support someone with so many Socialist tendencies.  Anyone with any sense of history knows that shit doesn't work.  No offense meant to any former Bernouts who are reading this and voting for Trump now, it's not your fault, you just need more experience and to maybe crack a few history books.
The Twinkie defense.
I was a Bernie supporter (still am), and almost everybody I know who wasnt a rep during the primary, was as well.  She doesnt have our support.  Never has.  Some have turned to Trump, some to Stein, and some to Johnson.  But not a single person I know, who supported Sanders, is voting for HRC in the general.  We saw her cheating first hand.  I cannot stress to you enough, be careful.  Watch yourself at the poles- make sure your vote counts.  Make sure you work the poles and everything is "by the book".  If you wonder why the most unpopular candidate in history doesnt seem to be worried, its because she isnt worried.  They have a plan to get the votes and it has nothing to do with appealing to voters.

I don't think Hillary supporters know what "out of context means". Her whole campaign is based off of the racist and sexist card. In addition, remember the time when Trump made his Second Amendment comment? That whole quote from him was actually taken out of context, yet the left were talking it about it for weeks. 
Everyone **online**. Does that make you feel better?
I interpreted what Jones said as $1000 or $5000 if you ALSO say the words / or BULLHORN. In spirit... the bigger thing gets the bigger prize. The smaller thing (just creeping around with the shirt) gets the smaller prize until max of $100k redeemed. That's what I heard.

Well look at it this way. This is just indicative of how worthless most college degrees are and the federal government that props up the failed education system. All thanks to commies like Hillary. Yeah, by going this route she openly admits that the failures of millennials is entirely on her shoulder as the Democrat presidential candidate.  If these college kids had actually went to tech schools or enter into apprenticeships they would be rolling in the dough and not be $120k+ in debt.

Everyone's a critic.  Let's not get lost in the minutia.  This is about Hillary, yet again, alienating a large percentage of the American people.  It's disgraceful.  What's she at now?  75%?  Can you image the state of a country in which its leader has such disdain for 3 of 4 of its citizens?   We need president who is with us, who has our back, and will fight tooth and nail for the citizens--this includes-low income youth, disenfranchised and struggling to make it in a rigged system.  We need a president who will make every decision based on one simple rule: will my actions benefit the American people?   
Trailer trash, rednecks, and basement dwellers are all open season. It's free reign on people who care about their future.

That would be me
This *is* the Donald!  Quickly, I would point out that Trump said in the primaries that he likes Planned Parenthood and that they do good work (the only Republican to say that).   He also has been saying that climate change is being used as a tool to pressure America into doing things that wouldn't be in our best interest. China is dumping *much* more CO2 into the air than we are, yet only America is expected to do anything about it. Odd.  Finally, Trump isn't really proposing trickle down economics. He's proposing across the board tax cuts; you would be bringing home about $100 more every check on a $40,000 salary. People in poverty *wouldn't pay income tax at all.* This isn't Reagan's trickle down; this is the government wasting less of your money and letting you keep it instead!  edit: also, Hillary has proven herself so corrupt that we know she has no interest in actually helping the American people. She will simply do whatever her paymasters tell her to.
&gt; For Clinton, politics trumped truth  Trump trumps politics
Is it worth winning if we have to become that which we hate?
Have faith in the God Emperor! He has a plan. If he's bringing in the afterburners, I'm sure it means he sees a value to having them with us. We must be smart, above all.
I try not to say "free healthcare and education" because it is not free, it is paid through taxes.   As for the problem of waiting time, more people would die from not getting the necessary treatment because they could not afford it. Not everyone can take out 50,000 dollar from their pocket with ease.   And of course not everyone should go to Universities, only the qualified should. Universities should have qualification requiments, not economic requiments. That risks rich dumb kids getting degrees and not poor but potential Einsteins.

True, but isn't that why you have Medicare and Medicaid? I was a RN in a hospital here in Canada and our hospitals are FULL with elderly people waiting for a nursing home who family refuse to look after them or just cant.  If I got sick, I'd be waiting for a bed in the ER for days. Our patients get sent to Detroit via the tunnel to get a cath done. They shut the tunnel and let the ambulance drive through to Henry Ford.   I work in Detroit now, and most seem to be telling me that before Obamacare, they had much better coverage.   Ontario is a fucking joke. I'm taxed to death here. My last energy bill was 348 bucks. Now our premier is adding a carbon tax on our gas, and taxing that carbon tax. Canada contributes like, 1.6% of global emissions in the world. Pay the highest energy bills in North America. It's crazy.   I just hope Donald puts our politicians to change and wakes all these cucks up.

I argued a bit for Trump with an old friend last night.   I got "racists hate being called raciwt"  followed shortly by "you sound like you follow Molyneux" for just trying to explain trump support, not even speaking about race.   I feel like he basically used the old "tie a rock to a witch, throw her in the water, if she floats, she's a witch, kill her". I sound like a racist, racists hate being called racist. It left me nothing to say. Pretty much ended the conversation. I feel horrible.

Haha exactly. We're racist-sexist-homophobic-xenophobic-deplorables but as soon someone says anything negative about hillshills they reee the fuck out like true autists 
Let them do it. Participate even. Go there and say you're a Trump supporter who has given up his evil ways.  If you're in a swing state tell them everyone you know is crazy about Hillary and that you haven't seen a single Trump sign. If they want to spread complatency and comfort amoungst Hillary supporters then let them.
No they don't and they will be kicking their own asses
Yep. All three primaries/caucuses that day had him take over 78%.
&gt; They're basically the same   LOL  "Imshi! Imshi!" --- Serbs when they tried to #removeKebab, but Clinton needed a war to distract from his oval office blowjob
Because they thought Trump won and/or liked what he said
The cuckoldry is hilarious.  And then they deny that Trump appeals to homosexuals.  He is the only one advocating to keep the people who throw them off of roofs out of the country.  I cant comprehend how they dont understand this
The papers/reporters just can't accept the fact that Trump's winning by a landslide. They have to cover the news, but they always manage to slip in a negative swipe or too. I look on it as pure desperation. ;-)
See that's exactly it... A lot of bernouts turned over to Hillary, but now she's burned that bridge...  She just insulted a group of her own supporters... Wtf is she even doing?
You British? haha you sound like a British school principal. "Perhaps a few beatings will set them right".

Well, yes, if we're bringing ethnicity into this, the first black president, and also the 44th white president.
Of course she isn't.   The problem is people are against D.T. because he's D.T. Not because of what he actually wants to do, just because he's D.T.  Often what people will do, is find anything they can do to back this up, without listening to each politician with an open mind.   This means they immediatly go to "Donald Trump is a racists because.... CNN says so and he hates black people and wants to put all muslims in jail..." they are reaching for invisible branches to make their arguments.   But at the end of the day, they are going to believe what they want to believe.    I think its a safe statement to say that there is a vast more percentage of people who are on HRC's side only because they dislike trump, than on Trumps side ONLY because they dislike HRC.

Hillary's social media strategy is, for a lack of a better word, abysmal.
I've been to three since March. Should I feel guilty?  :) 
Anyone who thinks this is is going to make a damn bit of difference to the people voting for Hillary are crazy.  The MSM is ignoring this whole thing and pretending it never happened.  Besides, I think we're being set up for some of the worse voter fraud we've ever witnessed this election.  They're already talking about how databases might be hacked.  In other words, they will be hacked and guess who that will favor.
I dunno, NY is pretty deep blue but God Emperor has Rallies here. Or at least he did during the primaries. 
&gt;Question: Why should the USA give up our "veto" power which allows us an assurance to keep the multi-stakeholder community / ICANN honest on conducting day-to-day / annual business?  Technically, to prevent fragmentation.  Should we do it from a political perspective ? I don't think so. Foreign states fragmenting DNS makes more problems for them than us.

I didnt make any comment on gay marriage or the parties in my comment above.  FWIW, I dont give a fuck who gets married to who or what. I do think youre an idiot if youve ever voted on a candidate or attended a rally based on that belief, one way or the other.  Frankly it doesnt really matter at all so getting worked up over either position makes you an idiot in this economic climate. Tax benefits are null for most people. The adoption issue isnt a legal issue, it comes down to policy of those organizations.  Its just a piece of paper.  But, since you brought party politics into it... Barack Obama, the candidate you presumably voted for twice, betrayed single issue gay voters twice in the two most recent elections.  Its hard to blame republicans when you do it to yourself.  It literally took an act from the supreme court to legalize gay marriage.

I'm an attorney, but I don't know what could be done? Hillary and the Clinton machine are basically untouchable.
Can someone explain this to me. I watch the rally's, I listen to Donald, I SEE the support out there for him, but how the fuck does the MSM show that Hillary is even marginally ahead? I was listening on my way to work (MSNBC, I know) and it's says he's a couple points behind nationally, but across the states it looks like they're turning red. How is this even possible they're even that close?  I had to get rid of my FB because of how fucked up it is on there. I live in Canada so it's a bunch of liberal fucks. I actually got in a argument with a friend ( I use that term loosely) and she said to me "do you actually think Trump would be better?" And I said "do you ACTUALLY think Hillary would be? What do you like about her policies? Her accomplishments? What's stood out to you that you like about her since she was Secretary of State? And don't give me posts from Buzzfeed and Huffington Post".   Fuckin' crickets. I had to get rid FB out of fear from back lash because you KNOW I'll be called a "Rayciss".

Hillary Clinton knows a thing or two about minimizing income taxes too:  "In previous returns, when Mr. Clinton was the Governor of Arkansas and his wife was a partner in a Little Rock law firm, the Clintons had gone so far as to deduct $2 for underwear donated to charities. The deduction was ridiculed by comedians and pundits, and the White House did not itemize the Clintons’ $17,000 in charitable contributions on the 1993 return." http://theconservatarianreview.com/the-clintons-donated-used-underwear-to-charity-wrote-it-off-on-taxes/

The issues are bigger than campaign personalities. This battle at the polls is going to be the citizens of America led by trump vs the corrupt establishment.     If you keep researching how deep the corruption, unconstitutional fascism, and frankly turn coat administration- keep digging and open your eyes to the truth. Disavowing everything that is Clinton is easier when you're woke. 
I said it in the other thread and I'll say it here. If Assange has the dirt I think he has, it'll blow Crooked Hillary, Obama, and the MSM too right out of the water. The irony is, the media could have gotten clear of it, but by shilling so hard for Hillary, they'll get flak for it too.   I suspect it has something to do with Benghazi.

We all know he was likely threatened, but he really did let everyone down. He has had a repeated pattern of weakness which is sad because I can tell his heart is in the right place. He ruined the Audit the Fed bill and let Ron Paul down along with everyone hoping that bill would pass. He started a movement and then gave all his donations to Hillary. He didn't need to do all the things he did such as letting BLM take over his mic. This man is not leader material. He's a good person, but he's not leader material because the evil take advantage of the weak, no matter how sweet and nice they are.

My question is why call her Secretary Clinton?  She hasnt been Secretary of State since 2012.
Oh noes, he has an antisemitic six pointed star on his chest! (it isn't)

Thank you. The question I needed to ask but couldn't find the right words.
Education =/= intelligence. How many smart people have not gone to college because of the circumstances in their lives? How many got training for careers in trade?  I'll never understand why liberals think you are "uneducated" because you didn't go to a liberal college and get a 4 year degree in a certain field. Apparently having a bachelors in literally anything means you are smarter than most people. 
Better be good man
# THIS IS THE QUESTION 'PEDES  It reminds and rubs salt in an old wound for afterBerners (keep the party divided), exposes the corruption in government and how it's all rigged, and once again shows her horrible judgement. All of these are big talking points for Trump.   This is such a perfect question because there is nothing she can say to spin it to look better, nothing. DWS rigs it for Hillary, DWS steps down, Hillary rewards her. Please spam this question around and make it a post. 
This happened in 2015 bud.

I'm right there with you. After he hired Farage I said to myself: 'this has to be it. He's peaked. There's no way one man can get any more based.' But I've said that so many times I'm excited trying to imagine how he's going to supercede this.

I've always thought she was hot. Sadly was brainwashed back then and voted for Obama. Still thought she was hot. Honestly I think that's why the media tried to shut her down so hard. She represented a normal, well accomplished woman who didn't ride anybody's coat tails and happened to be Republican. Clearly unacceptable for young girls to have an actual political role model so that had to drive a tractor over her reputation.
I don't get it. I've heard he was going to sue since NYT obtained the documents illegally...but if Trump is who leaked it, how is it illegal?
CTR spammed em to death.

The difference is that media doesn't cover hillary's stuff. They colluded with the DNC (sent in articles before publishing to get the OK), they refused to talk about hillary's health (going so far as to fire people or take them off air if they did) up to the point where she publicly collapsed and they couldn't deny anymore.

&gt; This isn't some advanced loophole.  Exactly. Liberal rags and channels try to spin this as if Trump somehow tried to game the system and would have you believe he's on par with Maddoff.   They're knowingly misrepresenting how these taxes work. Man, I hate the media.
Wow, I want a copy of the positions portion of this to spread around, it counters so many narratives. Is there an easy way to do that?
Van Jones maybe too
So many desperate libtards in youtube comments, I can't wait to see them foam at the mouth when he wins.
Trump says obey law and order.  The_Donald doesn't give a fuck.  ...wait what? 
Oh shit I remember that! Everyone telling Bill jzzz jokes messed up😝
So's sex...but that's another story
This is the single most important story to me. How in the fuck does one human misplace 6 billion dollars. Or if the State Department as a whole did this, it points to her being the worst Secretary of State of all time, totally unfit to be President. Trump is our nations savior.

Feliz cumplianos amigo
No one is talking about the Internet Takeover? No one. Its just the first morning too. Our government just gave away one of our freedoms, or, at least, a very big part of it, to the Globalists. Our government just made our country smaller than it was, less free. Thinking that, and seeing our response, makes me wonder why we cant see the Globalist are still winning. Our government is giving away our rights to freedom of speech and self-determination to the Globalist. And we have done nothing about it. On Nov. 8th let's do something about it! No matter what, VOTE! We are all here cheerleading but we have to vote. If we have one chance its now and, as unlikely as it once seemed, Donald Trump is our one choice. They are going to try and steal it. we really do have to overwhelm them. Not just in swing states but every state. We can't write off places like NY or California, the safe states. In EVERY state we have millions of DEPLORABLES. Every vote, from every Deplorable, in every District, in every State all count. Seriously, this is Trump we are talking about. We break records. Its as simple as that. We are WINNERS! We want the popular vote and an Electoral landslide. We have Nationwide enthusiasm. In some states there have been Deplorables risking their public safety to live Free and express their support for Trump. They are Heroes of this Movement. when the dust clears and we win this thing, their names will be in history books as Heroes. We will be the Generations that saved this country. But we have to vote. We have to support Trump as much as we are able, hopefully inspiring others to do the same. We all know we lose friends on social media over Trump support. I bet a lot of our associates in life will vote for Trump if they see us doing it with pride. We deserve that pride too. What we are doing with Donald Trump will change our country for the better. All we have to do is vote.
I hope and pray that there really is something there AND she has another medical event between now and the election.  There's no way the media could cover for both.
Why the FUCK is this not all over the front page? Get this upvoted centipedes! This is THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT issue about any candidate ever!
They are not actual people to her.
But don't worry, Jimmy.  You'll always hold a special place in our hearts and the next-to-worst president ever.
You won't regret it. Honestly.  We really are going to Make America Great Again. I promise!
Ah that makes sense - pretty based move to pull that off no matter who you are

Hilary rigged the campaign so that Bernie lost. Honesty is valued among the deplorables.

CTR is in full force on r/politics, to the point of having gained some serious influence on the mod team. 
I imagine it's in preparation for Trump going after her and her defence of Bill's rape escapades.
What the fuck would this have accomplished? Better still, what would it have accomplished *now, on Oct. 2nd???* 
Lets hope so but the article says it was Roger Stone that said she is done. Its also mostly a recap article. I was hoping it would say someone with access to Assange said it. Stone may be. I dont know. I sure hope he is right though.

Cool, man...all are welcome here, its an amazing phenomenon...black, white, gay, straight, men, women, Hispanic, Jewish, Republican, Democrat, independent, rich, poor, working and not, young, old....Trump has erected a yuuuge tent, and no one is excluded. This is a movement the likes of which has never been seen, a real revolution against the corrupt nightmare that is  DC.
Hey I'm moving to a new state next week, do you know the protocol for people like me? 
&gt; Go to Alaska. Find a pack of wolves that killed a caribou or whatever. Try and take that meat from 'em. You'll find out right quick that they know what property rights are.  So, by your philosophy, wild wolves have inalienable individual liberties such as property rights?  Wow.  I think you're putting the cart before the horse here.  Wolves ARE property.  You can own a wolf, like you can own dogs and cats.  Go the the zoo, and look at those animals, and tell me about their property rights.  You're incredibly naive if you think there exists ANYTHING in the wild other than survival of the fittest.  The fact that wolves will attack you in order to eat is not evidence of property rights.  It's evidence of a survival instinct and nothing else.  Dogs, cats, and even wolves, are human property ONLY in so far as a government acknowledges specific rules of ownership.  Property rights cannot exist without governments.

My roommate came back to our dorm around 3PM. Obviously he had been partying. I get woken up by barfing, to which I could smell the barf. It's 10:30 and sleeping beauty still hasn't cleaned it up. I can relate.
I am 46 and all I can say is that our country feels more and more controlling as time goes by.  It first started with small things --like the requirement to wear seat belts and that has grown into requirements like health insurance and both restrictions are criminalizes if you don't comply.  The noose gets tighter and tighter in every direction.   We make less and less money because of the money grab of our politicians.  Now in addition to taking money for us for their whims for Americans they take money to provide for illegals and for numerous countries abroad including those who hate us.  If we continue in this direction it's only a matter of time until there is a collapse of our country or an organized revolt.   We have to have a new direction--no doubt about it.

Yes unfortunately a lot of people voting for Hillary are all feels and no reals 
I would imagine pollsters take that into account in Pennsylvania due to the publicity of their support... but you might be right
They're only doubling down on it because they realize she fucked up.  So they repeat it to act like "no, no - we're thought leaders and we meant this."
Bernie is not pro 2a he wants guns only for hunting
Cal Thomas is a nationally syndicated conservative columnist who writes for dozens of newspapers and Fox News. He'll be fine.
I'd wager that forcefully ripping the mask off of the US Shadow Govt would qualify. Rumors are that the content Assange has stretches back to W. Not big, fucking MASSIVE IF TRUE.
Montgomery county:  2008-2012 - Obama shit everywhere   2016 - very few signs and bumper stickers. What you do see is majority Trump
Well that certainly changed my mind.  Trump is the devil.
They must buy PEPE!
&gt;her supporters will believe only Hillary  That's true. But she has very few actual supporters. Hence embarrassingly low rally attendance.  Most of her voters just hate Trump more than they hate her. If Assange delivers something truly spicy, they will probably switch over to our team because "lesser of two evils".

Get this to /r/all, this is proof of voter fraud
Bullshit.  There are tens of millions of us and we are heavily armed.  If things ever boil over, we will win and they know it.    Be on the lookout for another foreign war if Hillary manages to avoid prison and end up in the White House; it will likely be a false flag to bring the population to heel, as she would say.    This goes without saying, but anyone in the military should plan to get out ASAP, if Hillary should get elected.   That way you won't have to defect.  
The new Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., re-utilizing the old Post Office building, had its front defaced with some idiot writing BLM and other BS on the front.   So many assholes in the world!

He has a 88 GB AES256 encrypted insurance torrent floating around with a dead man switch attached to the decryption key. If he dies, it is because he leaked everything about the person that ended up killing him. That, or one of the more mentally ill of us killed him.

You guys need to read the article. Assange said he will be making an announcement from his balcony, nothing more. Trump's campaign is the one claiming it will destroy Hillary. While that result would be great for America, I'm not holding my breath.

I've already tried many times, and it's just not going to work with them. I've sadly think this particular sis is a ........ snowflake.   I am still working on my other sis, though. I sent her a bunch of links to read and videos to watch yesterday. I did find out her husband is all in for Trump, so he's also working on convincing her.   My parents have supported Trump since he announced he would run. My mother, especially, loves him because of the way he tells it like it is. She's the same way.   
What a spineless little bitch! And to think some people actually wanted to make him the president and negotiate deals with Putin. He literally shits his pants every time someone says Trump. 
It's amazing that the government is so corrupt he can get away with it 
The media bias is truly sickening and scary to me. 
Of course it does. Timing is everything.
It's a minor inconvenience and should only be implemented in areas with high crime.    If you live in a peaceful area it is totally unjustifiable.

The sad thing is, unless it's something that'll get her indicted, nothing will change the mind of her deluded followers.
Even then, that wouldn't change the minds of many.
They tried to with Redditgate. We need to do the same thing we did when that happened: spread it everywhere, save it, contact congress about it, post it all over social media. 
Yup. Have been watching him for awhile and it is very clear to me that he is trying to moderate his tone, image, and views a bit for more 'mass appeal'. Honestly, although there is nothing really wrong with it, i personally am wary and find it a little off putting, as it shows he is trying to make himself more 'vanilla' where he can in order to prioritize maximizing viewership. That is a small part of why we are where we are today with the MSM, and i guess i am just to the point where i prefer a person's full, unadulterated viewpoint.  Still gonna watch him though, and if i was in his situation, i too would try to capitalize as much as possible.
Wasnt it DNC donors?
&gt; but I don't know any Clinton supporters except for lesbian friends/acquaintances whose personal lives are train wrecks.  That's exactly it. Maybe those Hollywood cucks living in gated communities too, but they're too detached to understand the real problems real people face everyday.
Holy shit. Would love to have been a fly on the wall when Bern got the Crooked Hillary phone call in the middle of the night telling him to fix this.

Yeah man whenever I visit my fam in Ohio(theyre all Republican diehards:) I like to go through amish country. My mom has an amish freind she likes to give yarn and stuff to so ill go out and drop it off for her. They always are super happy to see me they offer me homemade dessert and wre really nice people, like if one if them ran for president Inwould vote for em in a heartbeat because they are really selfless people.

They will come up with any absurd line of reasoning to support the endeavor.  All leftists can ever do is subvert and destroy institutions. They do not build systems, ever. The only thing they sometimes produce is vulgar and agitating "art".

I honestly think the only reason why CNN gets public hits (restaurants, airports) is because how easy it is to stream. And how CNN used to be legit news. Watch the BBC for real news

well, the announcement has been canceled now, soooo...
I think the point you're trying to make is there's hundreds of ways to activate a dead man's switch?  which I get.

I wish people would stop trying to make Michael Moore relevant. The one thing that guy wants is attention and he keeps getting it.
Cities like Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Erie, Altoona, York, Lancaster, ect. are going to be critical.  We can make up the difference there.  Obama won nearly all of those, some by wide margins.    Philly isn't the force it appears to be, there are numerous 100k areas throughout the Commonwealth
Fact check:  How many of these refugees are plumbers? 
They are annoyed by the immorality of pretend neutrality. What's hard to understand about that?
Nice. Raising money for an American election in Paris. 🙄
I'm talking about the time since the last significant conflict. What the heck do you think NATO is? They can't just magically disarm people. Sure they can sanction and agree to intervene but your assuming most countries in Europe won't immediately pick sides. The US will be unable to openly declare a side without angering and harming extremely valuable trade relations with the other side. The power houses of Europe would have free reign to destroy each other.
might have taken this long to go through the archives, parse the info into a readily-digestible format and verify, etc.

Julian Assange: most unlikely looking bamf of all bamfs.
Why yes, I'd like some more jpeg very much, sir.
Some ideas i have  1) Undeniable proof of pay-to-play in the emails.  Like an email where she says "I give you this if you make a donation'  2) Proof she weapons caches in benghazi  3) Proof of selling arms to ISIS, secretly selling arms to someone else  4) Proof of collusion with the media  5) Some other proof of corruption in the government involving obama  6) Some dirt on the Iran deal  7) some proof the FBI investigation was a sham (this would be another leak, as this dates passed her emails, so does #6, the iran stuff)  8) emails showing clinton/ obama undermining national security/ anti-terrorism efforts  9) emails showing clinton/ obama using the government to target political enemies, such as proof of the IRS targeting.  10) Proof of collusion with google or another tech company.  those are all ideas/ possibilities i have thought of/ seen
HAHAHAHAHAHA and this is why This Bernie supporter now reads the_Donald religiously.  I knew that shit was bullshit when it was called out.  Optics my ass, taking advantage of the uneducated masses
This is the only article reporting the cancellation. It cites a two-day-old tweet that says "per @wikileaks." There is no such tweet on Wikileaks' Twitter feed.  There is no credible source for the cancellation story.
Wow that was brilliant.  Chuck looked like a complete idiot.  
Campus police would be best bet.  Threats of violence usually have zero tolerance and campus cops are often obligated to report any incident involving a student to the school board as well.
The point is we would support him if he was actually on the team. He isn't, so fuck him.  Doesn't mean we can't call him out as a hypocrite. Mercenary. Ha. He's a fucking Ice Cream Salesman. A joke.

Is it really a surprise if everyone expects it? More like Octobermas presents.
I'm so distressed right. I'm literally shaking.
Old lady needs to come forward and press charges against this scum especially since it is all on video.
I ran across an article that says that Hillary wanted to use a drone strike on Assange in 2010.  http://truepundit.com/under-intense-pressure-to-silence-wikileaks-secretary-of-state-hillary-clinton-proposed-drone-strike-on-julian-assange/  Don't know enough about this source to make it a stand alone post..  However,  maybe he decided the balcony wasn't a good idea.
Can someone please fill me in.  When did Ted Cruz become favored among us? What did he do? what the hell is going on
I still believe you are a cuck. That makes us even though, right?
They're bringing feeble memes, they're hacks, and some I assume are failed writers.
Based Nazi!
By making the info release a high-profile event, they're basically forcing the media to cover it.  They won't be able to bury the story.
No the only thing that Assange has said was before the election. 
They just want to be part of the first woman president being elected before they die. Extremely selfish. 
Who is this frog chin!?!?🐸🐸🐸🐸
cool,now if he will just release something.  until something comes out i wouldn't hold my breath over this.
I'm not going to elect the New York Times either. 
That was a case that was tried and failed? If I accuse you of being racist, are you one? On your second point, that's basically here say, same as secret service agents saying that Hillary uses the n-word all the time.
Gotta admit they're making him more likable.
Also, untrue. In fact average Asian incomes have been constantly declining since June of 2015. I have the sense you might be an afterburner. Asians do much better then metizos and African-Americans as well as Arabs however they are currently being significantly outpaced by whites and statistical trends indicate that this gap will only grow.   Ps is you are going to try to prove a point. You are going to have to come up with a source, not an "I'm lazy" sort of deal

Thanks.  Wish I could attend one, but sadly he isn't holding any overseas -- unlike Shillary, who apparently [just had a fundraiser in Paris (which the Bushes attended)](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3817829/Another-Bush-Hillary-Barbara-Bush-spends-Saturday-night-Paris-partying-Huma-Abedin-Clinton-fundraiser.html).  Foreign donations are allowed? :-/
I am not able to vote for Mrs.Clinton for a couple of reasons.  First is her lifetime of corruption.  She was fired from the watergate investigation by a life long democrat for lack of ethics, etc.  This pattern is still in evidence. Secondly is her lack of accomplishments.  Best summed up by remarks of Colin Powell in a hacked email. Her health is questionable as well.     Voting for Trump because alternative is Clinton who I believe will be a disaster.   Trump will be able to put in the hours, and despite his mouth I think he is trainable on the job.

Glad to see this video is finally stickied, saw it thebother day and messaged the mods, they didnt sticky it. Probably waiting for the best title, think they chose wisely.
What I don't like is the people who are obviously intelligent, and in the past at least tried to see both sides, hating Trump for reasons that don't even make logical sense. It's one thing to have issues with Trump, it's another to just blindly follow the mainstream narrative when you claim to be a free thinker.   Jon Stewart hates Trump. Bill Maher is even worse, since in the past he generally hasn't been afraid to call out issues with his own side. He said very nasty things about Hillary, then had to do a 180 and shill for her nonstop while bashing Trump. I watch talk shows occasionally, just to see biased they are. The last few I've tuned in to, Maher bashes Trump usually within the first minute, literally. Basically "Hey, guys, thanks for the applause, welcome to the show! Fuck Trump, right? What an idiot! Ha ha ha!"  Every similar talk show I've watched recently also generally bashes Trump within two minutes of starting. But Maher pisses me off the most since he should know better. Come on, Maher, drop some of those logic bombs you're so fond of.

When the crowd yells over a Marine, I believe that Marine has every right to keep speaking up. He was not heard nor respected. And that is a sad thing when an American cannot respect an American who put his life on the line for them.   Regardless of etiquette. This Marine stood up for his brothers. 
This is an older story before the 15 yr old.

Trump/Pence 1868
It's true. He came in, pushed his globalist pro-immigration bullshit and then tried to slander the entire grassroots movement in the UK as racist, including Farage - gaming for his own position as leader of UKIP with the she-shill Suzanne Evans. Both were exposed, and now exist on the fringe of the party. A punishment far too lenient. 
Crowder's been on fire lately. I'd link to other posts of his, but I don't feel like getting banned again.

plot twist: what if it is actually an older man dressed up like an old woman pretending to be a millenial feminist?
Because it's clear that it's a pepe whether you change its color or expression, it would be like posting a picture of Milhouse and calling it pepe, if you did that it would no longer be a pepe, once you have changed all the fundamentals to the meme then it is no longer the meme, pepe edits still maintain parts that make them identifiable as pepe. You seem to have (and others clearly have) struggled to identify this meme despite the fact that it uses the exact same words, if you can't tell it's the meme despite it being identical then how can we expect anyone to tell it's the meme when we make changes to it?
Wow, they really pull out all the stops to earn those CTR shekels.  Soros knows how to get value for money.  17c per hour buys some really high quality cuckposting. 
I guess. But at some point the millennial "girls" are going to become women who want a strong man to stand by their side. I don't care what is trendy, no women respects a man who isn't their equal.

My stepfather cleaned my father-in-law's grandfather's clock. 
Not sure who you're referring to, but Clinton did say, "They're children of the Great Recession and they are living in their parents' basement." She didn't actually say "basement-dweller." 
recording is dumb enough, they posted it online!

What I don't understand is how the secret service and anyone/everyone could tolerate knowing she has a diagnosis for a degenerative problem like that and hide it from the public while trying to run for office. You would imagine that there is some sort of duty to the public and nation to reveal these things before Election Day. That she made it this far is scary. 
That was at the beginning of his term, much has changed since then.  I will hold further judgment until he has proven himself with actions, not for himself, and that he is truly on the Trump Train, not just trying to keep up, pushing a hand car' to save his "career".
#STEAMWHISTLE
My grandmother said "These people will make up anything to make Hillary look bad." So I ask her, "If you don't believe what they are saying about her at all do you believe the stuff that is said about Trump?". She says "They don't have to make stuff up about him! Just look at how he is!" They believe that Hillary is this righteous god send and Trump is 100% evil. 
It's just being honest. It's like me asking a used car salesman if I need a car...
She admitted to being an accomplice to an assassination attempt, and making death threats to a judge of that case. She admitted all this live on CNN in an interivew with Anderson Cooper. The judge also publicly said this was the case at the time. 
Old eyes here...lol.

He doesn't need to be aggressive and bury her. Everyone who likes that is already voting for him. The people he needs to convince are the hold outs. People who hate Hillary, but think Trump is a wild card/unhinged. He really just needs to stay Presidential and try to be able to sound good (he doesn't even need to win on policy). He also needs to not be baited so easily at this point. Just my opinion anyways.  I realize we all want to see a bloodbath, but we're voting for him no matter what I'd say (barring some Black Swan event). He doesn't need to cater to us, he needs to win the swing voters.  Edit: I think I misread your comment. I think we agree.
That's so funny. Is there any one who has hurt the black community more than the Clintons?

I'd say there were several Swedes who get it, on here - plus the roughly...25% I think it is now, who support their nationalist party which wants to tell Muslims to fuck the hell off.
The truth of what the Muslims did began to be suppressed in the US in the late 1800's. I don't know what caused the change, but can only surmise that some very powerful people began funding a campaign to suppress the truth and pushed a different agenda. Karl Marx died in 1883. I suspect his financiers are behind the change in Western history regarding the Crusades. The Crusades really didn't last that long...but Islam's assault on the west...Christianity has been going on for Centuries and is still going on and has never ended. It ebbs and flows, but the surge is on full throttle right now.
Agreed. Election Day is going to be the scariest day of my life thus far. 
Fuck off, that's what they should do.
They have blinders on. I had this convo with a friend and he just refused to accept it. "Those are only extemists"

Is this case this is just the greatest meme of the election "the delegates, Dahnald" being repurposed. Ted did bend the knee and gave a very lengthly and thorough endorsement of Trump. He also has said he would help Trump with the debates. I actually respect *some* of Ted's Senate work (he is pretty based when it comes to the internet and freedom, sort of like Rand Paul is).   Agree he is still El Rato but there's some positives to having him help us take down Shillary.

Serious question, how are the Amish able to stay informed about what is going on and be informed enough to support Trump without using modern technology? Meanwhile most people that are anti-Trump have access to information at their finger tips yet are completely uninformed. Are Amish people using modern technology and internet to stay informed or is Trump's message being spread through more old fashioned methods? When I went to a Trump rally I would have never even known it was happening without the internet, but somehow all of these Amish people showed up to this rally without using the internet(assumption but maybe I'm wrong). I find this really fascinating, the idea of how information can still be spread and messages shared in an old fashioned way. With the whole internet censorship issue that MAY potentially occur as a result of icann transfer I think we have a lot to learn from the Amish when it comes to the spread of information, sharing ideas, and staying informed.

holy shit people, this is disqualifying. 
stupid Anderson does not understand that Americans want the truth. Hillary brings a classless character into the political discussion.  Trump exposes the truth about the character and  then Anderson accuses Trump of non presidential tweets related to porn while at the same time Anderson conveniently forgets that Hillary was the one who introduced the topic while hiding the truth.  How does this bozo get selected as a debate moderator?

Im led to believe these giant "other" categories go to things the charity watch indicate. Unless someone can explicitly indicate otherwise, I think this is a losing argument. The real argument should be that its still used to influece, like all the donors that got state appointments, most memorable to me was the guy that got put on the panel that dealt with top secret issues after some ridiculous donation, despite having no creds whatsoever.   Thats the purpose of this fund, to peddle influence, not to just pocket a bunch of cash (primarily)

Why am I not surprised it would lead to this? Would you believe they STILL try to use the ''Trump supporters are violent'' bullshit? Do people consciously filter this stuff out or do they just not know? 
But. 300k spread out across Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. If we can get 50k Amish votes in PA, that goes a long way to counteract the Philadelphia votes.
It works as long as the money actually goes back into the company and into the economy. Unfortunately it's too often that it instead just goes into the pockets of the people up too. 
Wait, you didn't give me $1B dollars? Holy shit, I can't believe you just stole $1B dollars from me!!!!!

Highjacking Sticky for video that must be watched.  This WWII survivor explains how socialism and gun control led to the take over by Hitler. She explains Hitler's policies that were put in place. These policies are very similar to what Obama has done and what Hillary plans to do. This needs to be watched and spread around so people can wake up to what is happening within the democratic party.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-awkYhtey50  edit: CTR shills have already downvoted the main post of this video.

At least compare apples to apples: Hillary called Flowers a 'gold digger'.   Trump treated women equally - he hired a woman to be in charge of one of his construction projects in NYC in the '80s. The first woman to do such a job.  #This is a pathetic attempt to distract the public right before the election. WE NEED THE MEDIA TO FOCUS ON THE WIKILEAKS INSTEAD OF SUPERFICIAL STORIES PRODUCED BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN
If you want to see what I think is the paragon of independent film with the smallest budget possible - skip the Blair Witch Project - and watch ["Primer"](http://fmovies.to/film/primer.j7w8/rjmwzp).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film).  A 7k budget. Film stock and editing costs were diffused by storyboarding the entire film in advance. Production value was further enhanced not with money but with time. They spent 2 years  post-producing it. The entire cast is the creator, writer and director of the film and friends and family members. But you wouldn't know that - or perhaps you might since it's a family and friend focused story with a fantasy premise, so it fits perfectly.  It does NOT look low budget, and the story is so good - that if you think you know what's going on - ever - you're wrong. In fact you may not be right until you watch it a second time.  Finally it's rare to find a movie that works so smart as this one. Not every production - let alone a micro-budget film includes the Meissner effect and Richard Feynman theories.  But that's what makes it work. There's no exposition - you're just thrown into the character's situation - and have to figure it out as it goes along - and it moves pretty quick. If you hate films that spoon feed you with exposition and spoilers to the point that you know the ending before the first 10 minutes of the movie is done - you'll LOVE Primer.  **(note: I have ad-block, you may want that turned-on if you click the link. Not sure how 'pop-up' happy the site is because I always have mine on)**

You have a worse immigration problem? Considering a large fight for leaving the EU was due to immigration, it's a huge statement to say it's larger with the current migrant crisis in Europe. 
Speaking as a Catholic, I hate the Christian stance on gender and marriage.  In no way, shape or form is gay marriage going to hurt heterosexual marriage. It's been federally recognized for how long now? Nothing has changed for us heterosexuals. It doesn't destroy anything. We've been destroying our own marriages for centuries now, with no help from the LGBT community.  And as far as gender theory is concerned, while I don't buy into a lot of the gender-queer rhetoric I see on the internet, again, what are they going to do to anyone? The existence of people who think their gender is fluid, or non-binary, or whatever label they want to give themselves for what they are, has no bearing on what us straight, heterosexual people do or think. We don't wake up one day and think "you know, I think I'm going to start dating 'same gender' today."  I believe in God, but I don't believe God judges us the way the Church does. And again, that's coming from a life-long Catholic. 5-10% of the population being LGBT can't be a fad, deviance, or mistake. And God doesn't make mistakes.  Trump 2016. MAGA.
That's a man, baby!
And with all those hours invested in learning gender and feminine dance studies - they just didn't have time to learn the basics of finance.

Trump supporters are optimistic patriots. We believe in a better future for ALL American citizens--black, white, Latino, Asian, etc.--where everyone can prosper and enjoy a good life. To fix many of the problems in this country, we must address root causes and problems: destruction of the nuclear family and unemployment.   Bringing jobs back fixes one part of that equation and many things down the line. Strengthening the family unit is something that can come with time and is a necessary area for us to focus lots of attention on. We believe that we our in control of our futures. Optimism, folks. Real hope. Real change.

Yup!  Plus, people need to understand simple math--the reason the Lefties (or,Lovies as they call them in Britain, heh, heh...) want specifically Islamic 'refugees' (rather than Christian or Hindu or whatever) is because they know Islamics WILL NOT INTEGRATE.  And remember, in order to create one gigantic global government, you must first eradicate local national cultures (German, American, Swedish, whatever).  Muslims reproduce at a much, much higher rate than do Europeans.  Take Germany, as the prime example. Germans reproduce at a rate of 1.2 per generation.  Muslims reproduce at a rate of 8 per generation.  Here's the math.  Start out with 1 million Germans and 1 million Muslims living in Germany.  In one generation, you now have 1.2 million Germans and 8 million Muslims.  In two generations you have 1.44 million Germans and 16 million Muslims.  Three generations you have 1.72 million Germans and 32 million Muslims.  Four generations you have 2.06 million Germans and 64 million Muslims.  Germany is already fucked and the globalists are now in an all-out push to bring this globalist Utopia to the biggest, richest, fattest prize on Earth.  America.  We reproduce at a 1.6 rate.  The math is there.  We simply must win on November 8.  We must.

Folks, we're going to win. That is the first point I want to make.  The second is this. You need to own firearms. You need to be proficient with them. You need to know how to safely operate them. You need to teach this to your eventual children.  Remember, no matter what, that your rights do not come from the government. Your rights are your rights. The second amendment gives you the means to say "no" when they are infringed upon. Fascism can happen anywhere that a populace allows it to. So do not allow it. Do not defend your rights, do not ask for them, do not argue for them. Assert them. They are your birthright, and they exist without consequence to what your government believes. This goes for you folks in other countries, too.   Do not ask for your rights. Assert them. This is how America was born. This is how we stay alive.  They can't come and get you for saying something they disagree with. They cannot search and seize you illegally. Yadda yadda yadda.  But.  If you ever give up your right to own arms to defend yourself, they can do any of those things. And they will. This is as sure as anything on the planet, it's happened over and over again throughout the entirety of civilized history.  Your rights do not come from government. They are your birthright. Do not give them up.  And vote Trump, god damn it.

It was putting acid inside a dogs veins while watching it die slowly. Humans do this just for fun as well in very certain areas. Hacking, barking, screaming for a dog, whining, and other conditions that just keep getting worse. It is considered inhumane to do that be it animal or man no matter the circumstance. If it was done on a human it would be considered an international war crime.  If these people really wanted to get rid of dog like strays they could of just done what some countries do which is better in the sense that nothing goes to waste is that they eat them. Seen it happen to cats as well, along with bugs, pests, animals, and a bunch of other stuff.  Eating brains with a couple of other parts is not something that people that have never skinned, deboned, gutted, or strip can handle easily normally.  The point is that they do it not for any other reason than to just get rid of the strays which they leave out in the sun to rot. They did not show that the dogs were harming them, taking away supplies, or being rabid, but rather they were just annoying that they should be put down.

&lt;soapbox&gt;  We Christians may have strong personal beliefs about how things should be some times, but we (mostly, there are some exceptions such as WBC) acknowledge the authority and natural limitations of an earthly government.   We also mostly live by the idea of "live and let live".   At the end of the day, we're all Americans. If any of us -- Christian, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, Buddhist, what have you -- if any of us want to have a future, we need to put America first. Together, we cannot be overcome.   That's why they keep trying to divide us along arbitrary lines.   I may not like homosexuality on a PERSONAL level, but I still respect people who are homosexual, and I'll still associate with them the same as any of my friends. Because they're Americans, my countrymen.   So, to all the forces that would divide us, I invite then to look upon the Trump movement, the fruit of their divisive labors, and tremble at the beast they have awoken.   Make America One Again. Make America Great Again.  &lt;/soapbox&gt;

I'm a finance guy. I've worked in several different areas of finance and have a graduate level education in finance. The left is so wrong on Trump.   What is most interesting thing about Trump is human capital theory which can be found in his 'we want you to be rich' book. I have the same views.... Trump has a concern for personal equity and the negative effects of interventionism. He combines this with his brand of individualism...  The left has been consistently wrong of finance and economics. Never listen to them as a rule.
&gt;am writing you this letter to tell you how heart broken I am that you have made this choice. Not because I am a broke student pursuing a PhD in a field that is not exactly lucrative. Not because I rent an overpriced apartment in the Upper East Side that I struggle to afford. Not because I fear I will never be the one percenter that you have “pulled yourself up by your boot straps” to become, an immigrant Latino with no college education who built a multi-million dollar corporation from the ground up with his bare hands.  There it is.   Her dad is a hard working legal immigrant, self-made successful guy. Voting for Trump  The daughter is a spoiled little shit, who studied a worthless subject, lives beyond her means, and is all 'disgusted' about who her father is voting for to the point she is willing to shame him on the Internet.   I hope he cuts her off and stops supporting her. Just another entitled, awful, judgmental person.

I'm gonna disagree. I find it simply bewildering that an uber-cuck like Joss Whedon could make something so awesomely libertarian as Firefly.   I can think of a half dozen Malcolm Reynolds quotes that apply to the Democrats perfectly. 
The public isn't ready for anarcho-capitalism. Especially because they've been coddled by the welfare state. I think it should be a goal we should work towards.   A system that empowers small to medium companies while guarding the state from globalism is imho currently the best.

I think you mean Don Bananas, but yes.

Get a good night's sleep tonight internet autists. 
For the people wondering why this is considered news, it's because one of the Clinton campaign's last ditch efforts is to paint Trump as a huge misogynist to snap away the female vote. Hillary is doing extremely poorly among women especially relative to what she should be doing considering she is quite literally the first female candidate for president. They're essentially hoping that women are stupid enough to side with their chromosomes.  The Clinton campaign has devolved into what amounts to calling Trump a mean person, and because he's mean he can't be president. That's it. 
There's an "incompetent" sub-compartment in the the "deplorable" basket.

Claim: Alt-right racists claim that 95% of Hungary rejects EU migrant quotas.   Fact: The actual number is closer to 98% Which is not 95%.  We rate this as liar liar pants on fire.
&gt;neo-fascist.   Lol. Keep throwing out those labels. 
She doesn't pander to the minorities simply for the minority vote, she does it for the white guilt vote. Stupid white people have been trying to do what black people think is cool for decades. Hollywood celebrities and musicians have made being black synonymous with being cool. After Obama was elected Justin Timberlake said "America is finally cool now" on the late show. Many dumb white people vote for whoever will make them fit in with their MTV indoctrinated friends. Blacks didn't elect Obama, white guilt and white followers did.
Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door
Yet his share amongst women has seemed to gone up in the last week in this poll. I'm guessing most women see through the unimportant bullshit being brought up by the Clinton campaign, or at least the hypocrisy of it.

Considering the differences in turnout that they're hiding here, Trump being +4 higher than indicated is actually pretty close to what I expect to see happen.
After enthusiasm, second major factor is how many new voters Trump pulls into republican column. First time voters are often excluded from polling. Trumpocrats often lie to pollsters.   We don't know how many of either type are in the USC poll. This has to account for at least 5% nationally. Right?

"relatively"  If your note is a 30 year note and you are depreciating the rental building over 27.5 years as required for residential, they match up relatively close.  You would not be using macrs accelerated depreciation on any buildings being rented out.  It's either straight line 27.5 for residential or straight line 39 for commercial.  The cash is leaving to pay principal, the depreciation is roughly matching that, what part of that did I not make clear?  This was left out in the original comment, like buildings aren't usually encumbered by debt, as they are, and that requires cash flow.
Not at all. No big lips, big eyes, no hollow empty soul look

No fooling here: since i've jumped on the Trump train, i have become a kinder, more respectful, happy and inclusive citizen.  There's nothing like scrubbing off decades of being an anti, to show that civic duty, manners and decency are still there.   MAGA, OP!   
Exactly.  Snopes, Politifact and other fact checkers are extremely precise or general depending on how they want to promote the issue.  A person can say they served in the Marine Corps and be technically wrong if they don't specify that they served in the Marine Corps Reserve.    Conversely, a person could say they "served" as a general statement and this could be rated "true" on anything from the Peace Corps to the 82nd Airborne.  It all depends on what narrative is being pushed.  The other favorite "fact check" tactic is to verify statements of opinion or sarcastic remarks.  I don't need someone to fact check that "Hillary was the MVP of ISIS" to know this statement was rhetoric.
Ohhh she was just kidding, of course! Lol

Flip the victim/aggressor relationship.  It's a tactic that Friedrich Nietzsche wrote about back in the 1860s.  Master Morality vs. Slave Morality.  It [sums up the kernel of Socialist thought very nicely:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#Slave_morality)  &gt;Masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master-morality with their slave-morality. Unlike master morality which is sentiment, slave morality is based on re-sentiment—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as 'good'.  &gt;Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is utility: the good is what is most useful for the whole community, not the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the will to power) are 'evil', as are the qualities they originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. Biblical principles of turning the other cheek, humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. "The democratic movement is the heir to Christianity."—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.
Only seen one Hillary bumper sticker. I'm up in NW suburbs and I only saw it when I was in Roseville.
Remember: profit margins on civilian firearms are shit.  Military contracts are their cash cow.  Just look at Colt; what have they done so innovative for civilians lately?    Hillary's whole position on guns is what she says (very anti).  But that doesn't mean she's not most likely to spend a lot of DoD money and/or get us into more small wars.  And that's good business.  Far better business than selling ARs to a saturated market.  Stay vigilant, gun people.

If was made to guess i'd say they will be used as justification for a nationalized police force.  but i'm really paranoid.    It's funny tho, recently had an argument about "hate speech".  The person completely ignored all my historical examples where labelling dissent as being dangerous to society was used as a justification  i used the khmer rouge and stalin's ussr.    then the person's counter arguments were almost word for word the reasoning that sent millions of russians to the gulag, you just had to switch the word "capitalist" with "racist".  As a student of history this scares the piss out of me, because i know educated dissenters are always the first ones to get lined up against the wall.
I'm hardcore conservative and I would have a falling out with my pastor as well. It's not just a liberal thing to not want your religion to start taking political sides.

Ammunition. Hillary knew about Bill's cheating. About his scandals. He probably threatened to divorce her, so she visited Webb and got knocked up. Now Bill is in a pickle (like a jar) - he can't divorce his pregnant wife, just think of the media. But if he exposes the child isn't his, Hilldog can expose his extramarital affairs, his rapes allegations, ect. Chelsea was a gamble to keep the Clinton veil together.

I don't think he's lost credibility indefinitely, just momentarily. As we've learned from Hillary's nomination, the DNC is rigged. I think Sanders is just playing along until he can try again. If he doesn't endorse Hillary, that's political suicide for him within the DNC. Doesn't matter what the people think of him, it's the DNC that controls the nomination.

We haven't had a Republican governor in many years, and IIRC a big part of him being elected is at the time there was a strong desire to reinstate the death penalty. Which we did, not that we've executed anyone.  As for mayor...Giuliani's predecessor was so terrible that he created an opportunity for a Republican. Unlike mayors for years, Giuliani ran on a platform of actually improving the city, not just managing the mess as best as possible. It's honestly impossible to explain how massive the improvements were. Homeless off the streets. Porn out of time square. Squeegee guys gone. NY became the safest large city in the US. Even bad neighborhoods started to come back.  Bloomberg came next, running largely on keeping Giuliani's policies in place. But of course over time, people who were too young or couldn't remember what a mess the city had been decided that proven effective policies like stop-question-frisk (everyone leaves out that question part) were discriminatory and the current mayor is rapidly undoing the same things that made the city safe.

We don't kill him, we decimated their military and let savages run wild. Helped ISIS tremendously. If he was putting open elections on the table we absolutely should have accepted.

Eh, this is dumb. Hillary openly discussing using drones to kill Assange should be the big headline.
&gt;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn’t want peace. She wanted Muammar Gaddafi dead for her own selfish, spiteful reason – the fact that Gaddafi had favored Barack Obama over her own campaign during the 2008 presidential election cycle. “**It’s well known in Libya that Gaddafi supported Obama over Clinton in the run up to the ‘08 elections, despite the Clinton team approaching Gaddafi’s son, Saif al-Gaddafi, and asking the family to invest in Hillary’s campaign and foundation, which they did not,” said Dr. Paul.** Hillary nixed the peace deal. The war continued. Libya – the most prosperous nation in Africa – fell into the hands of jihadist militants and subsequently ISIS. Thousands of migrants have since drowned in their desperate attempts to flee the country.  Very powerful stuff. How many lives would be tied to Clinton's (and Obama's) heads? Destroying a peace initiative because they refused the "pay-to-play" deal she offered!!!

Now when he's under asylum from Ecuador in their embassy in London. Dropping a bomb there would be cataclysmic with relations with both Ecuador and England. That would likely pull all of Europe into the fray and you know damn well Putin would step up to ally with England against an attack on two sovereign nations just to go after one target.   Edit: Putin, not put in. Damn autocorrect. 
Do you have a source? Wanna school some friends that need guidance
I think more ground would be gained by focusing on Hillary's deep money connections with foreign states that stone women to death for even perceived infidelity. That narrative shows her true lack of support for women's rights and is likely more appealing to many millennials than bringing up rapin' bill. Not that her behavior is excusable for smearing his victims, my opinion is just that other narratives might be more effective at gaining votes, particularly ones that focus solely on her and not the both of them.
The Clintons are thugs and criminals of the highest caliber.  I want their name to become sinonimus with traitor when this is all over.

I had a few friends share the occupy democrats (see: idiots) post.  Here was my response:  I'm not a trump supporter (I really just don't like Clinton), but I am a veteran (and I dealt with some very minor PTSD). This was pulled out of context from when he was answering questions about military suicide from a group of veterans. Here is the original quote: “When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in the room have seen many times over and you’re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can’t handle it.” He is referring to the insanely high percentage of combat veterans that commit suicide after returning home from a war zone. 22 soldiers commit suicide every day. This is an issue that NEEDS addressed and the media sure as hell should not attempt to put a presidential candidate in a negative light for talking about the problem.
Right - its just a bullshit excuse to launder money into the foundation.  She cant release the transcripts probably because she said the exact same thing at every speech which was a bunch of shakey parkinsons jibberish

All they have to do is rig florida in their favor. Who makes sure the voting isn't rigged? You guessed it, the FBI. Good luck to Trump. Even if he has 100% of the people's vote, somehow they will make him lose.

Well not being subtle would completely defeat the point. If it looks like an assassination then it makes him a martyr and vindicates everything he's ever said. Hillary wants to get away with her crimes not have a war on her hands because of them. They like wars designed to enrich them. Such a war would not be one she could profit from. 
Gross comments by Beckel, but [he has never worked for Hillary Clinton or her campaign.](http://www.snopes.com/bob-beckel-julian-assange/)   Further proof: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Beckel#Career  This clip is 6 years old (from 2010), so Hillary wasn't even campaigning that year.

Actually that is good cause it forces Clinton to spend more and more with doing barely anything or causing an opposite reaction. She loses more this way then opening her mouth.

DNA testing has already shown this guy is not bill clinton's son, it was debunked by Accuracy In Media years ago:  http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/clinton-didnt-father-hookers-son/  so if it isn't true don't spread it, because spreading it if it's not true does not help Trump, it just makes us look like conspiritards
She is.
What are these memes referencing?
Dead lives matter.
I disagree.  When Clinton mentioned his taxes he should have said, (partially what he did), "I'll release my taxes when hillary releases the 30000 missing emails and when she releases the transcripts of each one of her 250k dollar speeches she gave to banks, investment firms, hedge fund managers and countries that attack and bully women and gays."  And keep saying it over and over as long as Hillary wanted to keep digging.  I'm an award winning debater as well, but what you just did was cede the false premise of argument to Hillary and allowed her dictate the subject of the debate.  I probably would have killed you in a regulation debate.

Learn2English, retard. 'In' can be used to denote the specific object of reference in this context.  A comparable sentence would be to say "The 2016 election fielded one of the most corrupt candidates in political history in Hillary Clinton". That doesn't mean Hillary Clinton is a place. Only an idiot would read it that way.  Of course, with the IQ of the average Hill-Shill being pretty low, I can see how basic, everyday grammar could confuse you.

Somebody else posted here recently. Hold on, I'll see if I can find it.    It was a picture from a Twitter feed, from an undercover centipede.   The picture had an ambulance at Hillary's rally, and the ambulance was surrounded by swat trucks.  Hillary was late to show up to the rally.   So maybe something is up.
Seriously the man deserves justice.   
How can you tell legitimate incidents from false flags though, maybe look at it from that point of view. There varying groups in the black community that have different views. Some think BLM is a organization for racial profiling or police brutality, some like myself see it as a front for a more sinister plot to undermine peace between races, others are indifferent to it and only see what they media is willing to show them.  It's all to easy for those who would want to take 2nd Amendment rights and justify it with the nonsense you just said, by hiring actors of both black and white descent to stage a "brutal fight when you get just enough to satisfy rage and blood lust" without killing the person to incite more Dylan Roof's or these asshole black supremacist to take action and declare war on racial grounds.  Then the federal government decide to be the hero and rush in to save the day by taking weapons on all sides and implement martial law because of the heightened tensions. The best thing to hope for is that more African Americans can see through the bullshit by seeing stuff like this and not supporting BLM. This way the movement is organic and the black community can wake up to the pawnship that is being put on them by the banks.  
Yeah, and you're for the common people you Cupid stunt.

They're trying their best to equate it to the Clinton Foundation when it's not even close. Trump Foundation is very small operation with no expenses and doesn't perform the charity work itself unlike the Clinton Foundation. 
exactly what I was thinking.

Praying for you, Gov. Pence!  Don't back down on tough social issues.  Often times doing the right thing isn't going to be easy.   You are on the right side of history when you defend the unborn. You are on the right side of history in defending traditional values, while still extending love and compassion to those who disagree. (downvote if you must)   So I hope and pray that you don't back down. Quite the opposite.   Go stand firm.

I've been saving my good-boy points all year.
Exactly. It is supposed to be a place to openly discuss politics, yet that is only allowed if you are talking about politics that support their side. For being the self-described "tolerant" ones, it's beginning to become more and more clear that they are very very selectively tolerant.

&gt; It's more serious now, things are catching up I think.  The only people talking about her scandals are anti-Clinton. Literally everyone else says dumb shit like "Well she's been under scrutiny her whole life. Nobody is perfect! They've already debunked most of those right-wing talking points years ago anyways."  And that's how you dismiss literally any negativity if you're a Clinton supporter.

I have to have you guys come to my psych facility all the time. They know what they are walking into but they have been nothing short of amazing. I had an EMS worker help me talk a kid a off a ledge and he was better at it than some of my seasoned employees. Hell, when I got my TBI at work the EMS workers talked me into going to the hospital. I said I was already at one, (technically I was, but it was a psych hospital). You guys have I know see some terrible things and are on the front line when people truly need you. You play doctor, nurse and psychologist. I just want to thank you because I see first hand the work you do.

Nice try, but Wikileaks has not liked any tweets.  https://mobile.twitter.com/wikileaks/likes
That's kind of why I wanted an eli5. I think the action is very inconspicuous and am confused why so many people jump on a modestly priced property as evidence of corruption. 
Supposedly, people in the room laughed it off as a joke (probably albeit nervously).  I personally can't speculate whether she meant it as a joke, or if she meant it seriously, but there are two extremes here:  she meant it seriously and actually suggested they commit a war crime this is at the very worst).  The mildest extreme for her is that she was joking about committing a warcrime, and that should not be acceptable as probably the second most powerful public official in the world.  I don't mean to make an assertion as to whether she meant it or was joking, but the fact is, the strongest defense her shills have (and Snopes partially uses it here) is that she might have been joking so I figure I'd preemptively respond to it.
Don't see it either. Dems are just pissing me off more.

I don't know how you guys come up with these.  That's fucking hilarious. 
He clarified that the election stuff will be released before November 8
Didn't stone say Wednesday?
Man I had a feeling that nothing major was going to be released but I was hoping for at least something interesting, not some Q&amp;A where he can't even hear the questions and isn't answering anything but hey did you hear there were 10 million documents and 10 billion words?

If there is no new "surprise" the other 500 surprises about her are more than enough. It's foolish to think the MSM wouldn't cover up anything she did.
Definitely. We all got played, no reason to feed on each other for buying into synthetic hype. We have real hype. Embrace it. 
I don't like the way some people are slagging Assange off. Yeah, we're pissed, it's disappointing... but the guy has done so damn much to tear aside Clinton's wall of bullshit and expose the disgusting criminal treason she hides behind that *abuela* facade. What happened tonight was kinda painful, but that's no reason to throw Assange under the bus. He's done a lot more than I have to bring Clinton down and I'm grateful for it.

You don't sue terrorists. You waterboard them and/or kill them.
Lol I've been doing this for many many years but thanks for the patronizing comment. I believe what you're trying to describe is called "limited hangout" which is a type of controlled opposition used when corruption is intentionally leaked in a deliberate manner to reduce the damage caused by the information going public (Snowden has also been accused of this). I'm not saying you should trust him as a savior, only that you shouldn't call him a traitor when he's still going to leak more information that may be vital for the American people to become informed voters. So I suggest you quit talking out of your ass and also learn a bit more about your argument before you pose it to someone who's been at this for a lot longer than you. EDIT: a word
He is acting like a 70 year old man who happened to take multiple viagra pills &amp; can't get his dick up!

Your sexuality doesn't effect others, your political views do. If you and a few million of your closest friends choose to vote for and elect someone with an agenda in opposition of people wanting the other candidate in office, it will impact people's lives.    Why is that hard to understand?

People are acting like children who didn't get what they want for Christmas. It's disappointing, but give the guy a chance. There's still a month before the election. And he did make a good point about media Spin and their attempt to sabotage credibility. I'm not a Trumpeter 4 Julian, but I'm willing to be fair in the whole thing. Especially considering everything that he's leaking so far.
Anyone got some sexy pics of her in a bikini?
I respectfully request we keep the articles from CNN coming. We can not be Nimble Navigators if we exist in an echo chamber. What makes us strong is we can handle, and counter-point, the liberal narrative, while they cry REE REE REEE all the way home.
Well, kinda upset but who cares. Shillary is still a criminal and we still may get the leaks. 
Yeah, a place where they can go and think hard on their choices. A place to *concentrate*, if you will.
why didn't we listen
Future leaks will determine that.  I loved reading the leaked diplomatic cables. Lots of good shit.
HA!  CUCKED!!!
At this point, what difference does it make?
We shouldn't need anymore from wikileaks. Syria and Libya should be enough. Those wars were avoidable and we didn't plan for what happens next. ISIS and the refugee crisis emerged from it and are currently threatening all of Europe.

If that was a possibility, don't you think they would have engaged that prior to the DNCLeak?  While I don't know the reasons why, clearly those people existed back then, and were not able to be used as leverage to stop that, or any of the other major stories that he's blown the lid off of.  I'm not saying they're immune or anything, but to not use them to stop earlier disclosures just seems foolish unless something was preventing them from doing so.

lol. Better known as leakywicks.  
So easy? He has been saying that he has information that will guarantee an indictment of HRC. I think it is safe to say that it would most certainly affect votes if that were to be true. Which is seems less and less likely it is.  
u/Viking83 do you think Papa Trump is proud of me? My email made his crying article and was used for the title of it too! 
Let me repeat this again: Wikileaks never, EVER claimed tonight was the surprise.
i hope he truly has some good information in the coming weeks. this was a big let down.
Absentee ballots are already being sent out and a few states have mail in only ballots that will be going out soon.    Regardless, at this point I'll believe he actually has something when i can see and verify it and not one second before.    Troll level:  Shrek
So, after months of "I have something big to release!! I will eventually release something shocking!!", his press conference was just ""I have something big to release!! I will eventually release something shocking!!"?   Fuck it, at this point I don't believe that he has anything.
#MAGA ALL DAY LONG!!
its all good. just wanted to vent before going to work and i figured this would be the best place to do it.   MAGA
And so begins the fall of Crooked Hillary!
I'm genuinely curious how many threats he receives daily and the USSS's statistics to compare to other presidential candidates. I highly doubt that even then-Senator Obama received this much.
[deleted]
he couldn't even give the day?  so basically it could be anytime between now and next Tuesday and if he doesn't release in the next week, then he can't be trusted at all.
Correct the Record. It's a $6,000,000 superpac specifically meant to shit post and argue with trump supporters on reddit, 4chan, 8chan, predictIt and a few choice places.
We were NEVER relying on him.   Trump supporters don't need handouts. We will win this all on our own. 
Well they shouldn't have over hyped his bullshit wimpy tirade as being anything other than a casual waste of time.   Instead we got his supporters all but guranteeing us that it was worth staying up for.   I don't hate him, but he's a fucking idiot who wasted my time at this point and moment
They have been evacuated to shelters, but 55,000 still in tents from the earthquake is ridiculous and this will be another humanitarian catastrophe...

fyi your name MuntBerg; CoinMountain in Dutch. 
Hillary's people are probably the ones trying to push him to release prematuraly so they can counteract before the election.
Appears as if she doesn't have a lot of experience with integrity so she isn't sure how to stand by her convictions.

Name one American that deliberately goes out of their way to pay more taxes. Now name one American not named Clinton who could get away with compromising national security.
Right...you don't pay more or less taxes than you are legally required to.  Taxes are an obligation not a donation!

This is even more perfect now.  A strong movement can laugh.
I hate the Clintons and how they took advantage of them, but there is no damn reason why the Haitians shouldn't have been able to have repaired their country by now.  They seem like the type of people that we're going to have to help repeatedly forever because they will never get their shit together, and for once I wish our country could focus on our own ever-growing problems.
Trump supporters literally getting attacked: no big deal. Receiving 30 to 40 emails with spicy language: end of the world.
Awesome! But I thought we shouldn't post pictures of our ballots since they might invalidate them. No reason to take the risk. 
enough with the war on drugs. ok.  enough already.
just some typical negative spin propaganda  Trump: "my dick is big!"  Media: "Trump said Bill's dick is small!"
invalidate them? There's no way to identify me by this ballot, and it was recently ruled that selfies in the voting boots are OK. Plus, if this motivates 2-3 more people to vote that wouldnt vote otherwise, then it would be worth sacrificing one ballot.

I refer to it as simply the State news media. No better than Pravda or Tass at this point.
As a Marine I can tell you 100% certainty that mail in ballots are not counted or even opened unless the election is close, then they open the mail in absentee ballots and check them.  You want to ensure you're counted? Vote on Election Day.
Thank you based meme merchant
The Flying V, their v stands for vagina.
Wait, Trump did his taxes? What a monster! You know who else did taxes? HITLER.
What was the final result? Did it get removed? 
If his loss is big enough, he can carry it forward.  He won't pay taxes on his income until he covers the billion dollar loss.  But nobody knows when that might be.   I think there might be an eighteen year law for how far forward you can take it, but I am not a tax accountant or lawyer.
Okay. I mean just for the record, Roger Stone was the former Campaign Manager for Donald Trump 
Bullshit.
Was there a difference, or was it just the same shit in a different colored can?
Hey Obama maybe Kenyans were behind whites in Kenya because when the Roman Empire was building massive city states, aqueducts, libraries, coliseums, fleets of ships and roads across continents, the Nilo Saharans in Kenya were herding cattle and living in mud huts without so much as a written language.  I'm sure that's due to oppression from another culture they had never encountered somehow. 
If info was released that was considered the final blow, and Obama pardoned her an uprising would occur.  He's stupid, but I don't think he's that stupid.

There certainly wasn't a party or candidate who was going to back it up. Not excusing this but seriously the GOP is scared shitless of being called racists.
That means he's winning.
Wow the MSM is so full of shit right now
He didn't.  A lot of prominent online media figures embellished what Assange promised and created a wave of excitement for something that wasn't ever all that likely to happen.  Just because the mainstream media is fucked up as all get out doesn't mean that alternative and independent media is perfect. A *lot* of people - yes, Alex Jones, but others as well, to be fair - overhyped this and were basing their hype off of *nothing.*  Lottttttttttta disappointed people today. At the risk of getting downvoted to hell for sounding like a pretentious twat, I work in PR and I saw the writing on the wall when I was lurking here around midnight last night. I've never heard of a major public figure announcing something massive at 4AM New York time. As soon as I read what WikiLeaks had actually *said* about this press conference, I could tell right away that this would *not* be anything major. I believe, in fact, that they did this on European time specifically to *prevent* it from coming across as a big release and instead to make it appear to be exactly what it was, which was an anniversary commemoration.  Just my two cents. Hate to be the killer of dreams.
I'm just bummed... his credibility takes a little bit of a hit with this stunt.
SNL has been shit for a long time now
Any and all is possible :  1. He didn't promise an announcement on leaks yesterday. WE did that, Alex Jones did.  Wikileaks didn't.    2. Do we REALLY think he would trust a "secret" deal with a politician. Especially after the DNC leaks?  I guess maybe if they secretly sent him millions of dollars. But would politicians do anything like that with the single person who is most likely to out them for doing it ?    I think the answer is just much simpler.   If he releases 1, and only 1, false claim. His reputation turns to shit. So how does he decide if info is legit? Maybe some of it he cannot put 100% reliability on? I have no idea how that all works but it has to be a huge challenge.   He did just say a specific time this morning. (Which he hasn't before). We made up that he was releasing before the debate.  We made up that he was releasing this morning.  Now HE SAID he was releasing this week.

I mean... he was vindicated on the redacted 28 pages, so clearly you don't know as much as you think you do about 9/11 truth.   If you can only muster the vague ad-hominem attack of "conspiracy theorist", then I'm sorry it seems you don't know Alex Jones very well, and you are using the tactics the left has favored for many years to discredit character rather than content.  Please stop.
They think that because even with the media trying to cover it up, the sheer amount of Clinton scandals make it effectively impossible to do so, whereas Trump has 3 or 4 "scandals" that have any level of validity and get drowned out in the noise.  Clinton followers are not the type that know how to handle dissent, so *anything* that they don't agree with that makes it to their ears is MegaHitler.
Honesty in media will ONLY happen when "WE THE PEOPLE" demand it.

Yes you should. Point out their obvious leftist hypocrisy.
I feel better already.
I stopped watching SNL after Will Ferrell left the show. It's simply hasn't been funny for over a decade.
I was just about to post it, but of course nimble centipedes are quick as always!  And this is why we need a "America First" mentality, when it comes to culture as well.    Americans should not have to bend over backwards and assimilate to Sharia Law.   Islamists, if we allow them entry to this great country, need to assimilate to American cultural norms.    That's how it works... or is supposed to! 
Seriously, you really won't. I cut the cord 4 years ago, and it's great. I save around $100 a month, and still download or stream anything I need. Live sports can be a hassle at times, but that's really the only downside.
I'll have to start my day at 4 AM again, it seems.
Assuming that more than 1% of voters will even hear about that statement is wishful thinking.
So what does this all mean? The internet is officially being given away? What are the ramifications?
For all those shitting on Assange in this thread...this is someone who was hacking into the Pentagon as a teenager, who has lived in an embassy for four years rather than give in to the U.S. and U.K. governments. Somehow I don't think a few threats from the Clinton campaign are going to convince him to stop publishing.  On the other hand, its worth pointing out that Assange never claimed he was going to single-handedly destroy Hillary's campaign with a single leak. That is coming from fake articles and sensationalist media like Alex Jones. He does have info on Hillary, exactly what kind of info remains to be seen.
First time poster here.  I'm in a similar situation to the OP. 31 years old and raised as a democrat.  This election cycle has completely opened my eyes. I really can't put into words how disgusted I have become with the current trajectory of the democrats. it genuinely appears that the MSM has descended into Orwellian thought control.  The current socio-political PC climate terrifies me, and I strongly believe that Trump is our last hope to stop this cultural and political rot. MAGA!!

Damn son. Chris is gonna need some ointment after that sick burn.
Trump must take: GA, FL, NC, OH, IA, AZ, and NV   If he takes those, he's at 264, just 6 away from winning.   That leaves open: CO, WI, MI, PA, VA   I believe his best shot at getting that last state is either Colorado or Pennsylvania. Wisconsin is too cucked, and Michigan &amp; Virginia will go to Hillary I believe.  New Hampshire doesn't matter, and Main will favor Hillary. 
Stupid people who go to university aren't educated, they're indoctrinated and have 0 ability to think for themselves. Useful idiots. 
Can you please elaborate? Is he not delivering today?
Your story seems similar to a lot of people's, including my own. Welcome to the other side. I took the red pill back in April when I became curious about how an "extreme racist, sexist, islamophobe" could be winning the Republican primary. Turns out that the media was a bunch of liars. I jumped ship from Bernie to Trump.
I have an engineering degree, so my core classes were not cucked, and most of the people I went to school with were conservative (rational thinkers that use logic and not feels).  But we were required to take several social / humanities classes... these were absolute garbage, the professors were absolute garbage.  I was able to see through the BS, but I guess a lot of young impressionable kids (especially those majoring in those types of classes) were not.
Interesting it doesn't quote the total from 2008. Was it close to 2.5 million? Makes you wonder. 
Calling me entitled for trying to have discussion. You are no better than Hilalry shills on r/politics.   Btw all the examples you cited are either from pre election run or from Primary. We all loved him for what he is during those time, but expecting him to focus on issues and do better in debates shouldn't be too much to hope.

Is he still leaking the documents today?
Hahaha, I think we should send him more emails.
Roger Stone said the leaks were coming on Wednesday.

Lol! Trolls are trump supporters.
"woman tho"
Agreed, the DNC machine has a deep set of dirty tricks INCLUDING "running out of ballots". With the Bernie primaries many polling places "ran out" of proper ballots and told Bernie voters that waited in line for HOURS to use "provisional ballots" then those were lost, or not counted in mass. Oldfucks votes early and were 80% Hillary, Bernie hordes ended up waiting to be disenfranchised.   The DNC might be requesting ballots to force a similar situation or just to lower the feeling that EVERY 'pede get out and vote! Dont give em the satifaction!!!!!!
###HIGH ENERGY BOOK COVER!!!!
Ha! Sure, more like starting Friday of next week. Did I say end her campaign? Lol. You misheard me.   That last statement is what did it for me. Watch as his "leaks" are watered down DNC leaks. We don't need this nerd to win in a landslide. 
Yeah, imagine it on my end. He's completely unable to listen to proper reason too.
I was a poll worker in Wisconsin for the primaries. What we did was open the absentee ballots (these are filled out when in-person/early voting too), check them off our list of registered voters, and run them through the machine with all the other ballots. So, if day-of votes don't get counted, absentee votes wouldn't, either.  I think all states count these ballots on the day-of.
Some genius discovered he could export canned dingo piss if it was marketed as authentic Australian beer.

That "controversy" is evidence of how little the left thinks of their voters.  They think they are dumb enugh to believe it is bad, and they aren't wrong.

To add to this, the scariest thing is that once they have total control over the culture, and can control how people think, they can move towards taking complete control, in a physical manner. Abolishing the 2nd amendment and taking away guns will be cheered for, as it will make us "safer." We all know this is BS, most mass shootings are carried out in Gun Free zones, and criminals will always have access to them with free borders. All this does is takes away the populations ability to overthrow tyranny, and dooms it to corruption,  and eventually, cultural death.

I don't really know, it seems like something that could happen, and the science backs it up, and the science makes sense to me. However, ever since I got on the Trump Train, I've grown suspicious of things that get people ostracized for believing one way or the other.   I'm not saying I don't believe it exists , but I'm done making unsubstantiated claims only because it's backed the majority. One day I might care enough to actually do my own research on it, but aside from Internet searches and an article here and there, I'll never actually care enough to do it.

Ohio is rapidly falling out of reach.  Now that they MSM has begun mocking Ohio for being too old, white and uneducated, I expect Hillary's support there will collapse.

I know.. at one point when Bernie was cruising along, I thought the "lazy milenial" stereotype had prevailed, and we had gone from a country of acheivers, to a country of people with their collective hands out.  This sub gives me hope that a large segment of today's youth actually "gets it".   Govt isn't the answer, if anything it's 90 percent of the problem. 
You're a few steps behind everyone here, but that seems to have been addressed.   As for your thinly-veiled and altogether weak hive mind insult, it seems to me that pop culture, the MSM, and our branches of government are all driving a narrative that this SNL writer's comments exemplify. Your comments play right into that collective thinking. 
Trump is a President for ALL ages.   
And well they should! The fucking media took the context and not only spun it, but flat-out fabricated their own narrative of it. What a bunch of cowardly bastards.   I (for one) hope that the boycotting and derogatory image and stereotype that the 'media' has earned not only themselves but their sponsors has a lasting and significant negative impact on their revenue.

Rights are not the construction of men, so can't be created or extinguished by them. Man's power over such things only extends to recognition vs. non-recognition. That's the reason (from 10,000ft.) for the American Revolution. The various rights of the colonists were not being recognized and protected by the Crown.

That's because half didn't know about it since they never actually listen to Trump (only CNN / MSNBC because heads in sand) and the other half didn't care until Clinton mentioned it.

As excited as we are about this surprise, they, on the flip side are in shambles by it.  They were still ready with their blockers they prepared last night, as we're seeing with Twitter and Facebook censoring, but their guard being down opened up a chink in their armor today that we will gladly and easily exploit.

Welcome. Grab some flair and MAGA
&gt;After I was escorted to my car, the police alerted me that they had too much going on and had their hands full with the protestors who had started to gather across police lines. ABC 10 has aerial footage that shows I was subsequently assaulted WHILST IN MY CAR, and some protestors damaged my car. (Kicked my door and side panel.) I begged to just leave, but some violent protestors stood in-between myself and my car door, not allowing it to be closed. My Periscope shows that I did my best to shield myself in my car, but was still assaulted. I drove off and checked my car for the damage, which insurance adjusters tell me will cost roughly $1500.00 for parts alone, not including labor.  WTF dude! The cops just abandoned you? That's fucking bullshit, your life was in danger. I'm sick of cops in these cucked cities standing by and doing nothing to protect citizens who are being attacked. We saw it in San Jose, police would just stand there while innocent people were being beaten.  You should sue their ass, their job is to protect innocent civilians.

When they take something out of context or say Trump said something he didn't actually say, then it causes people to become agitated with Trump supporters based on a lie...that's false and dangerous rhetoric! We need to hold our media accountable for these types of attacks!!!!

So, during Bill Clinton's presidency, he introduced legislation which allowed banks to use shady business practices in the real estate market and create a bubble. This bubble bust during the Bush administration, and the shady banks were deemed too big to fail, we couldn't let them fail or else our economy would be shit. So Bush pushed the TARP loans, a $7 trillion bailout of said banks. These files seem to show that the banks all proceeded a certain percentage of their loans to the DNC. Very illegal money laundering scheme to put federal tax money into the pockets of democratic party politicians. If true, heads will roll.

yep, that verifies its veracity. Campaign directed downvotes are what you're seeing here.
This will end up being the biggest scandal in American history.
from his bio  "In 2014, Kevin finished his DCCC tenure as the Committee’s Director of Strategy and the Deputy Executive Director of its Independent Expenditure (IE) Program. Overseeing a twenty-person team, he used a data driven and an analytical approach to improve the effectiveness and lower the cost of the IE’s broadcast and cable buying strategies. At the same time, he presided over a cutting-edge, digital persuasion advertising program, one of the first to show a measurable impact on voter attitudes. Early success with this program led to a 450% increase in the DCCC IE’s digital spending over previous cycles."    Leak is 100% legit
I looked at the TARP spreadsheet, and the sum of the donations divided by the sum of the TARP money (spreadsheet formula =SUM(C2:C94)/SUM(D2:D94)) is 0.000000549. What am I missing?

I hope Gowdy and Chaffetz call for an investigation and drag them all in front of Congress. We should also do a search when the full database is available for Coney's name.
Yes she is alive. I believe she is getting treated for burns. 
I like how they have a file named "Pay to Play"
Call me skeptical. I looked at the spreadsheet that he linked on his site. There's less than $1M in donations. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely shady, but TARP was huge. The donations in that spreadsheet are like a pebble in the TARP ocean. Is there more?
It does if you go to extremes to get a high, but by then you would of already have to be a literal junky(The ones that would do anything to get a high).
Can someone explain this to me? The Foundation raised, received or solicited TARP money from banks?
[Hay wassup?](http://imgur.com/gallery/DpQ6r)

Holy hell! This post has lost 2000 points since I first saw it. 
Amount awarded in TARP funds is directly proportional to the amount the banks then donated to democratic politicians. 
Oh but see segregation allowed both groups to get away from each other. What they really want is for them to be able to get away from us but we can't get away from them. This means they can create organizations and programs to help each other and restrict access to those to those resources only to themselves, but all of our resources are for everyone.

You're probably thinking about the p-value, which is ideally less than 0.05. R works differently, it should be close to one. I did go to college and have a Masters degree. Also I'm a European who supports Trump all day every day!
I liked the skit where he is president and the President of Mexico walks in and hands him a check for 10 million dollars.
This is a very very rough answer but just to put it into perspective, 820MB of coherent text based data equals approximately 205,000 type written pages.  *single spaced
I don't see how Guccifer is extrapolating that the banks donated money and then received TARP money. Banks that were relatively solvent at the time of the crash didn't necessarily want TARP money because of the strings attached, like Goldman Sachs. But I do think there is something dubious about the Clinton Foundation recording this information. 
Ah. My timeline is off. I didn't actually look at when TARP happened.  Well then how is Hillary involved then if she wasn't SoS? Was she a senator then? My hypothetical was good fun, but I now I don't get how the Clinton Foundation is so ingrained in all of this if she wasn't involved politically. Very confused. Does this line up with her 08 run?
NY times used the same deduction. No laws were broken. No loophole was used. The tax code in this case worked as intended
crooked bitch of the west
Sorry, I wanna be a part of this revolution hell, I'd be the face of it if asked! But star wars... I don't think thats reasonable
No.  The banks who were given TARP funds donated to the CF or DNC.
You posted about this three times.  How do you know there's a dog there?  I don't see one at all.  I only see a flight attendant and Bill giving her a nice little how do you do.
Did you screenshot that?

Iran and Chess have a long history, that's like the only thing I can come up with.
South Park is arguably the most important show (and definitely most important cartoon) as far as social commentary goes. And they're intellectually honest when no one else is. Parody and satire are pretty important in western societies and Matt and Trey do a great job at it.
I am stunned half the voters are supposedly going to vote for her.  It really blows my mind.
"I've never once said I hate gays"  "Actually, we just fact-checked that and we have sources saying that you did indeed say the words "I hate gays" just now. Are you suggesting my sources are wrong?"
Looking at the folder set-up, I'm surprised they didn't just dump all the incriminating documents in one big file named 'MY TARP FRAUD LOL'.
Should I?
If I were me (and I am) I'd wait for proof before liking, commenting and subscribing.

more proof that trump is a clinton plant. a bill clinton plant to shut down hillary!
Millenial reporting for duty. Have a few friends supporting Trump, some others are super cucked
He is a police officer not a brownshirt. You want him to start arresting people for being democrats?  What you are describing would only escalate the situation.
Kaine is the kinda guy who says he is your uncle then makes you sick his dick

To be clear, this proof of the DNC, not the Clintons, right?
Remember when colleges were places of learning, study and development?   I fell sorry for all the millennials going through college now. The quality of education you're getting is horrific, especially considering the investment. Make sure you vett your choices carefully. 
Also the only thing she's accused of that wouldn't get her.jail time interestingly enough

How to convince your critics that you're peaceful? Trying to kill them doesn't seem very logical
Kaine the type of guy that learns Thai, so he can go to Thailand, for a thing...
NO STOPPING THIS SILVER FOX CONDUCTOR
Kaine is the kinda guy that didn't get a bid
Alex Jones is a joke.  The problem is he has drank too much filtered water to understand this.

It depends on what is released. The average person isn't going to know much about TARP, but they do know what murder &amp; treason looks like.   This is a big deal- but I think there's more to come. Watch this space: proof Seth Rich was the DNC leak and was murdered, proof Hillary provided SAP docs to Saudi.  Gowdy &amp; Chaffetz hold a fair bit of power, I wouldn't underestimate their ability to fuck Hillary's shit up

Make Trump an honorary mod!
Pay to Play is an SEC term.  Stop using the "Pay to Play" folder as some kind of evidence...it doesn't refer to the type of pay to play that Hillary implemented when she was in office. The conflation here makes us look like idiots.
Research this yourselves guys, the liberal media said he was crossing his fingers, but this signal is very real, and I highly doubt a trained officer who has full knowledge of its meaning would use this as a joke. We al know this dude got blackmailed after, so corrupt.

And the ADL is more than willing to do ugly shit, like trivialize Holocaust resistance, for the sake of the liberal agenda. [As a Jew (ethnically), this piece about guns offends the shit out of me.](http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/holocaust-nazis/adl-says-nazi-analogies-have.html) Specifically, the part where they call the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising "symbolic resistance" instead of "unsuccessful resistance".  Their narrative is that because the Jews, with very few guns, weren't able to resist the Nazis, it's nonsense to suggest that having more guns might have helped them. And to protect that narrative, they can't have Jews trying to resist, even unsuccessfully... so they rebrand it as "symbolic", as if they were just trying to create the right symbolism, rather than protect their loved ones. Seriously sick.
Oh shit its dat president  WALL UP!
"Mr. Kaine, what did you think about Hillary's outfit last debate?"
Here's rooting for Pence. Sucks that I can't watch, I have to work tonight. QQ
Wtf?  Can anybody explain.  Who r these people he talking about
CRIMINAL!  I've posted this 4 times already hoping to get this noticed.  "It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds."  Our Tax Dollars! Well I expect to be an Ambassador somewhere... warm and tropical. So yeah, I feel it's Special

OK, same canned, rehearsed BS from Kaine as we heard from Clinton. No way the dems don't know the questions before hand.

For lack of a better term... If you have a better term, i would love to hear what you call it so that i may adjust my terminology.
Kaine looks like an 80's camp counselor who touches kids during that summer in Virginia when I was 9. 
Like either Hillary or him care about America
It's been literally one question lol 
Kaine is bombing.
PENCE IS RILED
YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT KAINE!  RIP HIS FUCKING HEAD OFF PENCE!
Great question. 
It's my Governor!!! Mike Pence is amazing!
Every single sentence coming out of this cuck's mouth has to do with race.
[deleted]
"tell me why people don't trust Hillary?"  "Well, here's why I trust Hillary"  That wasn't the question you hilldo
Kaine is coming off petty. Keep it up
KAINE IS WAY OUT OF CONTROL
Kaine reminds me of that kid who knows he's wrong, but nevertheless attempts to say something along the lines of "my daddy is stronger than your daddy"
lolwut
This is going nowhere.  Tim cannot stop interrupting. 
Wow Kaine is a bitch 
[deleted]
Loving the silver fox tonight.  Calm and concise.
Donald Trump fact checking on Twitter.  Lie!  Lie!  Lie!
Pence is killing it. 
Kane is coming off like a whiney puss
We're only a few minutes in and I'm calling the debate for Pence right now.
SHE SOLD OUR URANIUM TO THE RUSSIANS DAFUQ
TIL Hillary is a member of SEAL Team 6.
Love that Pence is just so calm cool and collected in his attacks and defense. Cant Fence the Pence!!!!
YouTube stream is CSPAN
Wow there goes their 30 minute delivery guarantee!!!!!
I hadn't payed much attention to him either besides seeing his record and knowing he was an overall successful dude. A pleasant surprise.
the hired fired line creeeeeeepyyyyyyy

Tim Kaines voice grates on my nerves. It's nasally.
God the silver fox is destroying this cunt Kaine.

I COACHED WITH ELAINE'S HUBBY.  I'M TIMMMMAH
So, that's why all the millionaires and billionaire support Crooked ... is that correct Kaine? 
Looks like he's trying not to LOL
[deleted]
I actually really like this moderator so far. She is calm and cool and stopping both people. I'm assuming she didn't decide the questions but still. 
HE SAID NYT DID THE SAME THING. PENCE IS A BASED MAN.
kaine has a face worth punching
Kaine needs to STFU
This is fantastic. Pence is so based. Kaine and his eyebrows are unhinged 
The BBC guy on before nailed it. All Pence has to do is come out as the calm and cool guy to allay the perceptions of Trump being this irrational firebrand and its a walk-off home-run.   Pence is basically a toned-down Trump that ticks more boxes across the Republican voter base.
Wow, they don't even let Pence finish
This moderator is absolute rubbish who's job do you think it is to make it so they don't talk over each other? 
"Looks like I hit a nerve." BTFO!
Real good. 
Stfu creep. Trying to listen to a debate here 
Ive never watched to punch a screen so hard in my life....
my God Kaine would be a horrible president. 
[removed]
Pence: Here's this point laid out very clea-  Kaine: NO NO I NEED THE MIC  Pence: *Keeps explaining to the best of his ability*  Moderator: No, Pence, stop, you've talked for a whole 15 seconds, you need to stop.  Kaine: *talks for 15 minutes*  Moderator: *silent*  Pence: *starts explaining once again, calmly*  Moderator: No no no, it's time for a new topic
He sounds like a smarmy little twatty creep
He's frazzled as fuck
Kaine is making everybody sick thinking that his whiney boy reactions are coming from a kreepy smiling weirdo that wants to be VP of the United States.  
#KAINE CLAIMS HES PRO SECOND AMENDMENT BUT THEYLL APPOINT A JUSTICE THAT WILL OVERTURN HELLER 
If only there was a moderator...
The media is not going to have a clue on how to spin this tomorrow. 
# HILLARY &amp; KAINE MORE OF THE SAME.
He just gave HUGE win to Pence. What a dumbass.
When the creeeper feels nervous he interrupts...which is every fucking time 
Libtards love their story time 
I am not afraid to bring that up - Pence 
Kaine is a *Nervous wreck!*
REMINDER THAT CASTILLE AND HIS WIFE ROBBED A CONVENIENCE STORE THE WEEK BEFORE HE GOT SHOT

He said the guy killed at Virginia Tech survived the holocaust, the soviets, but he couldn't survive America's gun culture. To compare Nazis/Soviets to 2007 America...COME ON. 
Tim is just lying....constantly.....omg 
I guess it's a combination of Gucci and Lucifer.
Nope pour it on.
Now that's a real zinger!!
Ignore the whimpering of the weasel. The Fox is choking the life outta him.
SILVER FOX ON FIRE
#I AM A PROUD DEPLORABLE
Where was this cunt a few minutes ago when Tim Kaine was interrupting Pence every five seconds.
And she shoots him down and let's Kaine ramble 
#"IT IS HIS TWO MINUTES" - when pence says one word in objection. WHAT A FUCKING BITCH OF A MODERATOR. 
Was too busy picking up my tendies 
BASED SILVER FOX DEFENDING THE DEPOLRABLES 
That's Nonsense

ICE ICE BABY!  **SMACK**
Pence can't get a sentence in without getting interrupted. This is infuriating to watch.
